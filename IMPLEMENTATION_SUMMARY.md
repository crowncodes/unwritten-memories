## What Has Been Implemented

### Phase 1: Core Architecture Setup ✅ (Weeks 1-6)

#### ✅ Completed Components

1. **Flutter + Flame Project Setup** ✅
   - Flutter 3.35.6 configured (requirement: 3.27+)
   - Dart 3.9.2 configured (requirement: 3.5+)
   - Flame 1.20+ game engine integrated from day 1
   - All dependencies installed and configured
   - Project runs successfully with `flutter run`

2. **Clean Architecture Structure** ✅
   - Complete folder structure implemented:
     ```
     app/lib/
     ├── core/         # Constants, errors, utils, performance
     ├── features/     # Cards, game, relationships (feature-first)
     ├── shared/       # Services, widgets
     └── main.dart     # App entry with Flame toggle
     ```
   - Feature-first organization following 51-project-structure-guide.md
   - Data/Domain/Presentation layers properly separated
   - Barrel exports for clean imports

3. **Flame Game World** ✅
   - `UnwrittenGameWorld` extending FlameGame
   - 60 FPS game loop with fixed timestep physics (I/O FLIP pattern)
   - Camera and world system configured
   - Professional game foundation ready

4. **Card Component System** ✅
   - `CardGameComponent` with sprite rendering
   - Drag-and-drop physics system
   - Drop zone management for card targeting
   - Multiple cards render simultaneously at 60 FPS

5. **Riverpod 3.x State Management** ✅
   - Riverpod 3.0.3 integrated (latest version)
   - Manual Flame integration (flame_riverpod incompatible)
   - State providers for game and cards
   - Reactive state updates working correctly

6. **Development Environment** ✅
   - Enhanced `analysis_options.yaml` with strict linting
   - Quality controls configured (errors vs warnings)
   - Strict casts and raw types enabled
   - Zero compilation errors

7. **Testing Infrastructure** ✅
   - Comprehensive test helpers (`test/helpers/test_helpers.dart`)
   - TestDataBuilders for creating test data
   - CustomMatchers for domain-specific assertions
   - PerformanceTestUtils for timing tests
   - MemoryTestUtils for leak detection
   - Integration test skeleton
   - 37 tests passing, test framework operational

#### ⚠️ Pending User Action

**Firebase Integration** - Requires external setup:
1. Create Firebase project in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Run `flutterfire configure` in the `app/` directory
3. Follow prompts to connect the project
4. Firebase initialization code is ready to be added

**Note:** Phase 2 can proceed without Firebase. Firebase will be needed in Phase 4 (Narrative Systems).

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Firebase Setup (User Action Required)

**Firebase Configuration Steps:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Add Project" or select existing project
3. Name: "Unwritten" (or your preference)
4. Enable Google Analytics (optional but recommended)
5. Create project

6. In your terminal, navigate to the `app/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd app
   ```

7. Install FlutterFire CLI (if not installed):
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   ```

8. Configure Firebase:
   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```
   - Select your Firebase project
   - Choose platforms: Android, iOS (and Web if desired)
   - This generates `firebase_options.dart`

9. In `lib/main.dart`, add Firebase initialization:
   ```dart
   import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
   import 'firebase_options.dart';
   
   void main() async {
     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
     await Firebase.initializeApp(
       options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
     );
     // ... rest of main
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay Loop (Weeks 7-14) - READY TO START

Phase 2 can begin immediately without Firebase. Here's what will be implemented:

**Week 7-8: Turn-Based System**
- Implement 3 turns per day (morning/afternoon/evening)
- Turn state machine
- Turn progression and state persistence

**Week 9-10: Success Calculation & Meters**

- Build Physical/Mental/Social/Emotional meters (0-10 scale)
- Meter update system

**Week 11-12: Card Evolution Basics**
- Card versioning and evolution triggers
- State persistence in Hive (local storage)
- Evolution animation

**Week 13-14: Polish & Integration**
- Build UI overlay system (resources bar, turn indicator)
- Implement audio and haptic feedback
- Integration testing

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. **Follow Clean Architecture:**
   - Data layer: Models, repositories
   - Domain layer: Entities, use cases
   - Presentation layer: Components, widgets, providers

2. **Write Tests First (TDD):**
   ```bash
   # Use test helpers
   final card = TestDataBuilders.card(title: 'Test');
   ```

3. **Keep Files Small:**
   - Maximum 300 lines per file
   - One class per file (except small helpers)

4. **Use Const Constructors:**
   ```dart
   const CardWidget({super.key, required this.card});
   ```

5. **Follow Master Truths v1.2:**
   - Levels: 0-5 (relationships)
   - Trust: 0.0-1.0 (continuous)
   - Capacity: 0-10 (emotional)
   - Meters: 0-10 (physical/mental/social/emotional)

### Code Quality Standards

**Before Committing:**
```bash
cd app
dart format .        # Format code
flutter analyze      # Check for issues
flutter test         # Run tests
```

**Commit Message Format:**
```
