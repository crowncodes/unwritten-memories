# Unwritten Canonical Decisions Log

**Purpose:** Track all canonical decisions and master_truths updates to maintain consistency across documentation.

## Decision Log

### Decision #001: Season Length System
**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Version:** master_truths v1.0 ‚Üí v1.1  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Issue:**
- master_truths v1.0 specified "12 weeks (Extended: 24/36)"
- 1.concept/15-progression-phases.md specified "12-100 weeks variable"
- Contradiction in how season length is determined

**Decision:**
Use **fixed player-choice season lengths: 12, 24, or 36 weeks**

**Rationale:**
1. **Content balancing:** Fixed lengths easier to balance and test
2. **Player commitment:** Clear time investment up front
3. **Memory architecture:** Simpler context management with known bounds
4. **Narrative flexibility:** Achieved through:
   - Player chooses length based on aspiration complexity
   - Content density varies (routine batching vs. granular days)
   - Early completion option if goal achieved ahead of schedule
   - Can abandon season early if goal becomes impossible

**Implementation:**
- **Standard (12 weeks):** Focused single-goal arc, 2-3 complications
- **Extended (24 weeks):** Complex multi-path arc, 4-6 complications
- **Epic (36 weeks):** Transformational saga, 6-10 complications

**Updates Made:**
- ‚úÖ Updated master_truths v1.0 ‚Üí v1.1 (clarified player choice)
- ‚úÖ Updated 1.concept/15-progression-phases.md (removed variable length, added player choice explanation)
- ‚úÖ Added "How Season Length Affects Gameplay" section with examples
- ‚úÖ Added "Can You End a Season Early?" explanation

**Downstream Impact:**
- 2.gameplay/ docs will need 40-season-length-calculation.md (removed dynamic calculation, replaced with player choice + density system)
- Novel generation scales per season (12w = short story, 24w = novella, 36w = novel chapter)
- Archive display shows actual weeks played (can be less than selected if ended early)

### Decision #002: Relationship Level Progression (0-5)
**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Version:** master_truths v1.0 ‚Üí v1.1  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Issue:**
- master_truths v1.0 specified "Levels 0-5" but didn't clarify what Level 0 represents
- 1.concept/13-ai-personality-system.md started at Level 1 "Stranger"
- Unclear whether there are 5 or 6 distinct levels

**Decision:**
Use **0-5 (six levels) where Level 0 = "Not Met"**

**Rationale:**
1. **Database clarity:** Level 0 useful for tracking "never met this NPC"
2. **First meeting mechanics:** Enables special "first meeting" triggers
3. **NULL handling:** Cleaner than NULL vs. 1 for unmet NPCs
4. **Progression granularity:** More nuanced relationship tracking
5. **UI consistency:** Display "Not Met" instead of "Level 0" for player clarity

**Level Breakdown:**
```
Level 0: NOT MET
‚îú‚îÄ Never interacted with this NPC
‚îú‚îÄ Card not yet in deck
‚îî‚îÄ First meeting triggers ‚Üí Level 1

Level 1: STRANGER (0-5 interactions, Trust 0.0-0.2)
Level 2: ACQUAINTANCE (6-15 interactions, Trust 0.2-0.4)
Level 3: FRIEND (16-30 interactions, Trust 0.4-0.6)
Level 4: CLOSE FRIEND (31-75 interactions, Trust 0.6-0.8)
Level 5: SOULMATE/BEST FRIEND (76+ interactions, Trust 0.8-1.0)
```

**Level-Up Requirements:**
- Requires BOTH minimum interaction count AND minimum trust threshold
- High trust alone insufficient (relationship needs time)
- Many interactions with low trust insufficient (relationship needs quality)

**Display Format:**
- UI: "Level 3 (Trust 0.52)"
- Never show "Level 0" (display "Not Met" instead)
- Archives track Level 0 internally
- Never show "Level 6" or "10/10" format

**Updates Made:**
- ‚úÖ Updated master_truths v1.0 ‚Üí v1.1 (detailed level progression and requirements)
- ‚úÖ Updated 1.concept/13-ai-personality-system.md (added Level 0, detailed all 6 levels)
- ‚úÖ Updated 1.concept/11-card-system-basics.md (clarified 0-5 display)
- ‚úÖ Added level-up requirement formula (interactions + trust)

**Downstream Impact:**
- 2.gameplay/44-relationship-progression-spec.md will need exact thresholds
- Fusion requirements can gate on specific levels (e.g., "Level 3+ required")
- First meeting special mechanics unlocked (Level 0 ‚Üí 1 transition)
- Archive statistics track "met" vs. "not met" NPCs

**Issue:**
None - all docs aligned.

**Confirmation:**
- **3 turns per day** (Morning / Afternoon / Evening)
- **7 days per week**
- All concept docs and gameplay docs consistent

**Status:**
‚úÖ **ALIGNED** - No updates required

## Master Truths Version History

### v1.1 (October 13, 2025)
**Changes:**
1. Clarified season length system (12/24/36 weeks, player choice at season start)
2. Detailed relationship level progression (0-5 with Level 0 = "Not Met")
3. Added level-up requirements (interaction count + trust threshold)
4. Updated canonical constants
5. Updated compliance checklist

**Breaking Changes:**
None - v1.1 clarifies existing v1.0 intent, doesn't change systems.

**Migration Notes:**
- Docs referencing "variable 12-100 week seasons" should update to "player-choice 12/24/36 weeks"
- Docs starting relationships at "Level 1" should add "Level 0 (Not Met)" state
- All relationship level references should include interaction + trust requirements
