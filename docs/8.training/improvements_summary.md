# Master Truths v1.2 Alignment - Improvements Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the training data generation pipeline to fully comply with **Master Truths Canonical Spec v1.2**, focusing on emotional authenticity, dramatic irony, and novel-quality narrative systems.

---

## 🎯 Major Improvements

### 1. **Emotional Authenticity Prompts (Section 16)**

#### Before
- Generic "emotional capacity" mention
- No specific capacity calculation examples
- Vague capacity constraints

#### After (Enhanced)
- **Canonical X+2 Support Rule**: Character at X/10 capacity can provide UP TO (X + 2)/10 support
- **Capacity Factor Table**: Exact impacts for stress, exhaustion, trauma, etc.
- **Four Capacity Tiers** with specific behaviors:
  - **0-1/10 (Crisis)**: Cannot provide ANY support
  - **2-4/10 (Low)**: Acknowledgment only, no emotional processing
  - **5-7/10 (Medium)**: Moderate support, 30-60 min limit
  - **8-10/10 (High)**: Full deep support available
- **Capacity Calculation Examples**: Shows math (base 8.0 - 2.5 stress - 1.5 sleep = 4.0 effective)
- **Quality Requirement**: authenticity_score ≥ 0.7 (MANDATORY)

**Prompt Length**: Expanded from ~500 words to ~1,800 words for precision

---

### 2. **Dramatic Irony Prompts (Section 17)**

#### Before
- Mentioned three response types but didn't explain when to use each
- No knowledge gap scoring
- Missing capacity-perception link

#### After (Enhanced)
- **Knowledge Gap Score**: 0.0-1.0 scale (≥ 0.6 triggers dramatic irony)
- **Three Irony Types**: 
  - `character_oblivious_to_npc_truth`
  - `character_misinterprets_situation`
  - `capacity_limited_perception` (NEW)
- **Capacity-Linked Responses**:
  - Tone-deaf option: Most realistic when capacity < 4/10
  - Misguided option: Most realistic when capacity 4-6/10
  - Growth option: Most realistic when capacity ≥ 7/10
- **Player Overlay Text**: "(You know this is wrong, but [Character] doesn't...)"
- **Quality Requirement**: dramatic_irony_score ≥ 0.5 (MANDATORY)

**Example Quality**: Added two complete high-quality examples showing all three response paths with detailed reasoning

---

### 3. **Tension Building Prompts (Section 17)**

#### Before
- Vague "create tension through incomplete revelations"
- No specific types or structure
- No frequency guidelines

#### After (Enhanced)
- **Four Canonical Tension Types**:
  1. **Mystery Hook**: Unexplained references, behavior changes
  2. **Partial Reveal**: Show effect without cause
  3. **Contradiction**: Acts against established pattern
  4. **Stakes Escalation**: Time pressure, consequences
- **Frequency Guidelines** (Master Truths v1.2 Section 17):
  - Level 1-2: 1 in 3 evolutions (33%)
  - Level 3-4: 1 in 2 evolutions (50%)
  - Level 5: Nearly every evolution (90%)
- **Payoff Timelines**: 
  - Mystery/Partial: 2-4 weeks
  - Contradiction: 5-8 weeks
  - Stakes: Immediate to 2 weeks
- **Quality Requirements**: 
  - hook_effectiveness ≥ 0.6
  - tension_score ≥ 0.6
  - Must create "one more week" desire

**Example Quality**: Four complete examples, one for each tension type with specific hook descriptions and information debt tracking

---

### 4. **Memory Resonance System (NEW v1.2)**

#### Before
- Didn't exist in original code

#### After (Enhanced)
- **NEW DATA TYPE** aligned with Master Truths v1.2 Section 17
- **Five Resonance Types** with canonical weights:
  1. **Same Emotion, Different Context** (0.8 weight)
  2. **Opposite Emotion, Growth** (0.9 weight)
  3. **Past Trauma, Current Trigger** (0.95 weight - HIGHEST)
  4. **Joy/Sadness Contrast** (0.85 weight)
  5. **Emotional Growth Callback** (0.7 weight)
- **Psychological Realism**: Memory surfaces based on emotional resonance, not just recency
- **Literary Quality**: Creates "catching your breath" moments
- **Quality Requirement**: emotional_authenticity ≥ 0.7

**Generation Method**: New `generate_memory_resonance_batch()` using Qwen3-30B-A3B

**Example Quality**: Five complete examples (one per type) showing trauma triggers, poignant contrasts, and growth moments

---

### 5. **Quality Validation Enhancement**

#### Before
- Generic quality checking
- No specific thresholds per Master Truths v1.2
- Basic pass/fail approach

#### After (Enhanced)
- **Five Validation Metrics** (Master Truths v1.2 Section 17):
  - Emotional Authenticity: ≥ 0.7
  - Tension Building: ≥ 0.6
  - Dramatic Irony: ≥ 0.5
  - Hook Effectiveness: ≥ 0.6
  - Overall Novel-Quality: ≥ 0.7
- **Per-Sample Validation**: Each sample evaluated individually
- **Specific Issue Tracking**: Lists exact problems if quality fails
- **Meets v1.2 Standards**: Boolean flag for compliance
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Tells you what to improve

**Validation Prompt**: Now explicitly references Master Truths v1.2 and checks X+2 rule, tension types, hook quality, etc.

# Tension injection frequencies
tension_freq_level_1_2: float = 0.33  # 1 in 3
tension_freq_level_3_4: float = 0.50  # 1 in 2
tension_freq_level_5: float = 0.90    # Nearly every

# Memory resonance weights
resonance_same_emotion: float = 0.8
resonance_opposite_emotion: float = 0.9
resonance_trauma_trigger: float = 0.95

resonance_growth_callback: float = 0.7
```

**NEW Quality Thresholds**:
- Replaced generic min/max with specific thresholds per Master Truths v1.2
- Added validation against canonical minimums
- Throws errors if thresholds don't meet v1.2 requirements

**NEW Daily Targets**:
- Added `target_memory_resonance: int = 1000` (NEW v1.2 data type)
- Re-prioritized: Emotional (2000) > Dramatic (1500) > Tension (1200) > Memory (1000)

**Output Directory**: Changed to `training_output_v1.2` to separate from old runs
