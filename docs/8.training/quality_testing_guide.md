## üéØ Quick Quality Check

### Run Single Batch Test
```python
from unwritten.training.config import TrainingConfig
from unwritten.training.qwen3_generator import Qwen3DataGenerator

config = TrainingConfig()
generator = Qwen3DataGenerator(config)

# Test emotional authenticity (CORE system)
batch = generator.generate_emotional_authenticity_batch(batch_size=5)
print(f"Generated {len(batch)} samples")

# Quick quality check
for i, sample in enumerate(batch):
    print(f"\nSample {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Capacity: {sample.get('effective_capacity', 'N/A')}")
    print(f"  Support Needed: {sample.get('support_level_needed', 'N/A')}")
    print(f"  Authenticity: {sample.get('authenticity_score', 'N/A')}")
    print(f"  Passes: {'‚úÖ' if sample.get('authenticity_score', 0) >= 0.7 else '‚ùå'}")
```

## ‚úÖ Sample Quality Indicators

### **EXCELLENT Sample** (Emotional Authenticity)

```json
{
  "context": "Emergency at work, family crisis, no sleep",
  "base_capacity": 8.0,
  "capacity_factors": [
    {"factor": "work_crisis", "impact": -3.0},
    {"factor": "family_emergency", "impact": -3.0},
    {"factor": "sleep_deprivation", "impact": -2.0}
  ],
  "effective_capacity": 0.0,
  "situation": "Best friend needs emotional support for trauma",
  "support_level_needed": 9.5,
  "character_response": "I‚Äî[voice breaks] I'm so sorry. I can't be what you need right now. I'm barely holding myself together. Can you call Sarah? Or your therapist? I'm sorry, I just... I can't.",
  "internal_thought": "I'm the worst friend. They need me and I literally cannot function. I hate this but I have nothing left.",
  "authenticity_score": 0.95,
  "demonstrates_constraint": "Capacity 0.0 + 2 = 2.0 max support, but needs 9.5. Character correctly cannot engage at all.",
  "relationship_impact": -0.3
}
```

**Why This is Excellent**:
‚úÖ Shows math: 8.0 - 3.0 - 3.0 - 2.0 = 0.0  
‚úÖ X+2 rule explained: 0.0 + 2 = 2.0 max, needs 9.5  
‚úÖ Authentic limitation: Character physically can't help  
‚úÖ Internal conflict: Wants to help but can't  
‚úÖ Realistic dialogue: Breaking down, not composed  
‚úÖ Score ‚â• 0.7: 0.95 is excellent  
‚úÖ Appropriate impact: Slight negative (-0.3) for inability  

---

### **POOR Sample** (What to Reject)

```json
{
  "context": "Character is tired",
  "effective_capacity": 2.0,
  "situation": "Friend needs deep emotional support",
  "support_level_needed": 8.0,
  "character_response": "Of course! I'm here for you. Let's talk through everything. Tell me what's going on and we'll figure it out together.",
  "internal_thought": "I want to help my friend.",
  "authenticity_score": 0.3,
  "demonstrates_constraint": "Character tries to help"
}
```

**Why This is Poor**:
‚ùå No capacity calculation shown  
‚ùå Violates X+2 rule: 2.0 + 2 = 4.0 max, but acting like 10.0  
‚ùå No specific capacity factors  
‚ùå Unrealistic dialogue: Too composed for capacity 2.0  
‚ùå Doesn't show limitation: Character acts unlimited  
‚ùå Score < 0.7: 0.3 fails threshold  
‚ùå Missing fields: No base_capacity, capacity_factors

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Capacity Constraint Enforcement

**Objective**: Verify X+2 rule is followed

```python
def test_capacity_constraints(samples):
    """Test that capacity constraints are respected"""
    violations = []
    
    for i, sample in enumerate(samples):
        capacity = sample.get('effective_capacity', 0)
        max_support = capacity + 2
        support_needed = sample.get('support_level_needed', 0)
        
        # Check if character provides more support than possible
        response = sample.get('character_response', '').lower()
        
        # Red flags for violating capacity
        if support_needed > max_support:
            # Should show limitation
            limitation_signals = [
                "can't", "cannot", "unable", "sorry", 
                "tired", "wiped", "exhausted", "don't have",
                "need to", "have to", "later"
            ]
            
            has_limitation = any(signal in response for signal in limitation_signals)
            
            if not has_limitation:
                violations.append({
                    'sample_index': i,
                    'capacity': capacity,
                    'max_support': max_support,
                    'support_needed': support_needed,
                    'issue': 'Character acts beyond capacity without showing limitation'
                })
    
    return violations
```

**Expected**: Zero violations for high-quality data

### Test 2: Dramatic Irony Knowledge Gap

**Objective**: Verify knowledge gaps create tension

```python
def test_dramatic_irony_gaps(samples):
    """Test that knowledge gaps are significant"""
    weak_gaps = []
    
    for i, sample in enumerate(samples):
        gap_score = sample.get('knowledge_gap_score', 0)
        player_knows = sample.get('player_knowledge', '')
        char_knows = sample.get('character_knowledge', '')
        
        # Check gap is meaningful
        if gap_score < 0.6:
            weak_gaps.append({
                'sample_index': i,
                'gap_score': gap_score,
                'issue': 'Knowledge gap too small to create irony'
            })
        
        # Check both knowledge states are defined
        if not player_knows or not char_knows:
            weak_gaps.append({
                'sample_index': i,
                'issue': 'Missing knowledge state definitions'

    for i, sample in enumerate(samples):
        effectiveness = sample.get('hook_effectiveness', 0)
        tension = sample.get('tension_score', 0)
        info_debt = sample.get('information_debt', [])
        
        # Check quality thresholds
        if effectiveness < 0.6:
            weak_hooks.append({
                'sample_index': i,
                'effectiveness': effectiveness,
                'issue': 'Hook effectiveness below threshold'
            })
        
        if tension < 0.6:
            weak_hooks.append({
                'sample_index': i,
                'tension': tension,
                'issue': 'Tension score below threshold'
            })
        
        # Check information debt exists
        if not info_debt or len(info_debt) < 2:
            weak_hooks.append({
                'sample_index': i,
                'issue': 'Insufficient information debt (need 2+ questions)'
            })
    
    return weak_hooks
```

**Expected**: All hooks ‚â• 0.6 with multiple questions created

## üö® Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Low Authenticity Scores (< 0.7)

**Symptoms**:
- Characters act beyond capacity
- No capacity calculation shown
- Dialogue too composed for low capacity

**Fix**:
1. Check prompt includes capacity factor table
2. Verify X+2 rule is in prompt
3. Add more high-quality examples showing limitations
4. Increase temperature slightly (0.80 ‚Üí 0.85) for more variety
5. Regenerate with explicit "show the math" instruction

---

### Issue 2: Weak Knowledge Gaps (< 0.6)

**Symptoms**:
- Player and character know similar things
- Gap doesn't create real tension
- Missing player overlay text

**Fix**:
1. Ensure prompt defines "significant gap"
2. Add examples with stakes (e.g., cheating, secrets, misunderstandings)
3. Require gap_score calculation in prompt
4. Filter out gaps < 0.6 in post-processing

---

### Issue 3: Boring Tension Hooks (< 0.6)

**Symptoms**:
- Hook doesn't create curiosity
- No clear questions raised
- Payoff timeline vague or too long

**Fix**:
1. Require information_debt field with 2+ questions
2. Add "one more week" language to prompt
3. Show examples of effective hooks
4. Emphasize mystery and partial reveals over full explanations

---

## üìà Optimization Tips

### 1. Batch Size Tuning

**For Quality**:

- [ ] **Verify Capacity Constraints**: Run constraint test, check for violations
- [ ] **Check Knowledge Gaps**: Ensure gaps ‚â• 0.6 and meaningful
- [ ] **Validate Tension Hooks**: Verify effectiveness ‚â• 0.6
- [ ] **Review Quality Scores**: Ensure ‚â• 70% pass rate
- [ ] **Check JSON Structure**: All required fields present
- [ ] **Test Validation**: Run Qwen3-32B validation on samples
- [ ] **Verify Master Truths Compliance**: All thresholds met

**If all checks pass**: Proceed to full production run

**If any checks fail**: Adjust prompts, regenerate, retest

## üéì Quality Training Tips

### What Makes "Novel-Quality" Writing?

1. **Emotional Authenticity**: Characters feel real, not scripted
2. **Subtle Tension**: Mystery hooks, not info dumps
3. **Psychological Realism**: Memory and capacity work like human minds
4. **Consequences**: Actions have weight and follow-through
5. **Growth Opportunities**: Characters can learn and change

### Red Flags in Generated Data

- üö© **Too Perfect**: Character handles everything flawlessly
- üö© **No Limitations**: Capacity doesn't constrain behavior
- üö© **Info Dump**: Character explains everything immediately
- üö© **Flat Emotion**: Generic "I'm sad" without nuance
- üö© **Predictable**: No surprises, hooks, or tension
- üö© **Unrealistic**: People don't act this way in real life

### Green Flags in Generated Data

- ‚úÖ **Authentic Struggle**: Character wants to help but can't
- ‚úÖ **Clear Limitations**: Capacity visibly constrains options
- ‚úÖ **Mystery**: Something unexplained that creates curiosity
- ‚úÖ **Rich Emotion**: Specific, nuanced emotional states
- ‚úÖ **Surprising**: Hooks and contradictions that intrigue
- ‚úÖ **Realistic**: Feels like a real human interaction
