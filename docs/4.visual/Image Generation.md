# Sarah's Portrait Generation Prompts

I'll create three detailed prompts for generating Sarah's portraits at different relationship levels, designed for use with Stable Diffusion XL or Midjourney.

Now I'll create Document #3: Technical Architecture for Card Evolution System

I've created:

## 1. Three Portrait Generation Prompts for Sarah

Each prompt is designed for consistency using LoRA training:
- **Level 2 (Acquaintance):** Basic, tentative, just the blue scarf
- **Level 4 (Close Friend):** Confident, adds glasses and locket, holding notebook
- **Level 5 (Legendary):** Radiant, all signature items, in her bookshop, achieved dreams

The prompts include:
- Detailed consistency requirements (SAME facial features across all)
- Progressive detail additions (visual evolution)
- Emotional state differences (shy → confident → fulfilled)
- Technical specs for Stable Diffusion XL
- LoRA training instructions for maintaining the same character

## 2. Document #3: Technical Architecture (Started)

I've covered:
- ✅ System architecture overview
- ✅ Complete database schemas (SQLite + PostgreSQL)
- ✅ State management (Redux-like pattern in Unity)
- ✅ AI integration layer
- ✅ Real-time evolution pipeline
- ✅ Caching & performance
- ✅ Offline capability

**Still need to complete:**
- Synchronization system
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- Security & data protection
- Analytics & telemetry
- Scalability architecture

**Options:**

1. **Continue Document #3** - Complete the remaining 5 sections (another ~5000 words)
2. **Summarize & Move On** - Brief summary of remaining sections, move to Documents #4 & #5
3. **Focus on Specific Area** - Deep dive on one technical area you're most interested in
