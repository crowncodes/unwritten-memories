A landscaped urban waterfront park featuring a curved stone walking path along the river's 
edge, historic wrought-iron pedestrian bridge spanning to opposite shore, mature weeping 
willow trees creating natural canopy, ornate Victorian-era lamp posts (black with glass 
lanterns), and weathered wooden benches facing the water. River width approximately 40 feet, 
gentle current visible. Base palette: slate-gray stone path, deep green grass, black iron 
fixtures, rich brown wood benches, blue-gray water.

Warm golden hour light (30 minutes before sunset), long shadows stretching eastward across 
grass, sun at 15-degree angle creating rich amber glow on bridge metalwork, gradient sky 
transitioning from warm peach-orange at horizon to soft lavender-blue overhead, lamp posts 
just beginning to illuminate (creating dual warm-cool lighting), water surface reflecting 
golden sky with gentle ripples, magical hour atmosphere with perfect balance of natural 
and artificial light.

Peak summer lush foliage, weeping willow branches full and trailing into water, grass 
vibrant emerald green (recently watered), wildflowers in naturalized patches (purple 
coneflowers, black-eyed susans), river full and flowing smoothly, dragonflies visible 
near water surface, warm evening air suggested by open body language of distant figures, 
sense of long pleasant summer evening stretching ahead.

Crisp sharp details throughout scene, vibrant saturated colors, inviting serene atmosphere, 
clear atmospheric perspective showing depth into scene, welcoming peaceful ambiance, warm 
golden light enhancing natural beauty, optimistic color grading emphasizing tranquility, 
sense of perfect moment discovered, world feels expansive and full of possibility.

Clean authentic representation with no narrative tension. Location exists in pristine 
peaceful state, natural evening rhythm visible (couples walking, joggers passing, solo 
visitors on benches), focus on beauty and restorative atmosphere, sense of discovery and 
potential - this could become a meaningful place.

Wide public perspective showing entire scene without personal connection. No specific 
individuals emphasized. Park presented as beautiful public space waiting to accumulate 
meaning. Observer positioned as first-time visitor appreciating general beauty but not 
yet emotionally invested. Neutral welcoming presentation inviting exploration.

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation. Eye-level three-quarter view 
from park entrance, 20 feet into park with bridge visible 50 feet ahead as primary focal 
point, standing eye level 5.5 feet height. 16:9 aspect ratio. Rule of thirds composition 
with bridge at upper center third, curved path leading from lower right to bridge creating 
S-curve visual flow, weeping willow at left third. 3-layer depth: foreground (stone path 
texture, grass edge detail), mid-ground (benches, lamp posts, path progression), background 
(bridge, opposite shore, gradient sky). Primary lighting: golden hour sun from left at 
15 degrees, secondary: lamp post warm glow (2700K), tertiary: cool blue ambient from sky 
(6000K). Gentle atmospheric haze suggesting warm humid summer evening.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Peaceful, serene, open, restorative
- **Color Temperature**: Warm golden (3500K natural + 2700K artificial)
- **Saturation**: High vibrant (summer peak)
- **Shadow Density**: Medium-long (40% opacity, golden hour)
- **Detail Level**: High clarity, inviting exploration
- **Emotional Resonance**: Tranquility, discovery, potential

### Complete Prompt

```
A landscaped urban waterfront park featuring a curved stone walking path along the river's 
edge, historic wrought-iron pedestrian bridge spanning to opposite shore, mature weeping 
willow trees creating natural canopy, ornate Victorian-era lamp posts (black with glass 
lanterns), and weathered wooden benches facing the water. River width approximately 40 feet, 
gentle current visible. Base palette: slate-gray stone path, deep green grass, black iron 
fixtures, rich brown wood benches, blue-gray water.

Soft gray pre-dawn light with sun just cresting horizon, low angle creating long weak 
shadows, cool blue-gray quality (6500K) to early morning light, sky gradient from pale 
gray-blue to weak yellow-pink at eastern horizon, lamp posts still illuminated but appearing 
dim against growing daylight, water surface calm with subtle mist rising, quiet transitional 
atmosphere between night and day, lack of warmth in light.

Fall foliage in peak transition: weeping willow leaves yellow-gold but thinning, many 
fallen leaves covering grass and path (burgundy, rust, gold), morning dew heavy on grass 
appearing almost white, scattered puddles from overnight rain, air visibly cool (breath 
mist from early joggers), bare patches beginning to show in grass, sense of seasonal 
decline and transition, beauty tinged with melancholy.

Muted color saturation (reduced 30% from baseline), cooler color temperature throughout 
scene, emphasized shadows with heavier weight (55% opacity), more contrast between illuminated 
and shadow areas, subtle desaturation of foliage colors, atmospheric weight suggesting 
fatigue, details remain clear but mood shifts toward somber reflection, colors feel drained 
matching exhaustion, scene has beauty but it feels distant and hard to access.

MYSTERY HOOK: On "your bench" (the third bench from entrance, facing upriver where you 
and David always meet), there is a small bouquet of fresh flowers (white roses, still in 
grocery store wrapping) and what appears to be a folded note card, but David is not here 
yet. David's coffee thermos sits beside the flowers (his distinctive red plaid pattern), 
suggesting he was here recently and left suddenly. Morning mist partially obscures the 
bridge beyond, creating sense of uncertainty. No other people visible in the scene - the 
park feels unusually empty for a morning when joggers should be present. Sense of something 
important happened or is about to happen. Your footprints in morning dew show you've 
approached the bench but not sat down - hesitation visible.

Familiar personal angle showing this is "your place": the bench is positioned at specific 
angle you know well, view of bridge is the exact perspective you've memorized from dozens 
of morning runs, small cairn of river stones you and David built visible at path edge 
(inside joke between you), worn path in grass showing your regular route, personal connection 
to space evident but currently disrupted by mystery. The flowers and note create intrusion 
into familiar space - something has changed in a place that should be constant.

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation. Eye-level three-quarter view 
from park entrance, 20 feet into park, bench with flowers at center frame 30 feet ahead, 
bridge partially obscured by mist 50 feet beyond, standing eye level 5.5 feet height. 
16:9 aspect ratio. Rule of thirds composition with bench (and flowers) at center-left 
intersection, bridge emerging from mist at upper center, path leading eye from lower right 
to bench. 3-layer depth: foreground (dew-covered grass, fallen leaves, your footprints), 
mid-ground (bench with mysterious flowers, lamp post with dying light), background (misty 
bridge, weak sunrise). Primary lighting: weak dawn light from right (6500K), secondary: 
dying lamp post glow (2700K, nearly out), tertiary: reflected light from water surface. 
Atmospheric processing: slight blur at peripheral edges suggesting fatigue, cool muted 
palette, scene clarity maintained but emotional distance present.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Somber, uncertain, disrupted routine
- **Color Temperature**: Cool gray-blue (6500K)
- **Saturation**: Reduced 30% (drained feeling)
- **Shadow Density**: Heavy (55% opacity)
- **Detail Level**: Clear but emotionally distant
- **Emotional Resonance**: Confusion, concern, fatigue
- **Narrative Hook**: Unexpected flowers + absent friend + empty park = planted question

## Example 3: Afternoon | Medium Capacity | Stakes Escalation | Level 4 (Close Friend)

### Context
- **Turn**: Afternoon (3 PM)
- **Season**: Spring
- **Player Capacity**: 5.5/10 (functional but aware of stakes)
- **Narrative Tension**: Stakes Escalation (David asked to meet, says he's moving away)
- **NPC Relationship**: Level 4 (David, close friend, you've supported each other through major life events)

### Complete Prompt

```
A landscaped urban waterfront park featuring a curved stone walking path along the river's 
edge, historic wrought-iron pedestrian bridge spanning to opposite shore, mature weeping 
willow trees creating natural canopy, ornate Victorian-era lamp posts (black with glass 
lanterns), and weathered wooden benches facing the water. River width approximately 40 feet, 
gentle current visible. Base palette: slate-gray stone path, deep green grass, black iron 
fixtures, rich brown wood benches, blue-gray water.

Bright overhead spring light, shorter shadows directly beneath trees and structures, clear 
quality to air, scattered cumulus clouds creating occasional moving shadows across scene, 
vibrant natural light (5000K) without harshness, moderate contrast showing dimensional 
depth, sense of active afternoon energy but current moment feels suspended, light has 
clarity that makes everything feel sharply defined and present.

Fresh spring growth everywhere: weeping willow showing bright lime-green new leaves, grass 
vibrant emerald with recent growth, early wildflowers blooming (daffodils, crocuses), trees 
in background showing pink-white cherry blossoms, river flowing stronger with spring melt, 
sense of renewal and growth that contrasts with current situation, nature's cycle continuing 
regardless of human concerns, ironic beauty in this moment of potential loss.

Balanced neutral tone appropriate to medium capacity: realistic color saturation without 
dramatic enhancement, even lighting distribution, comfortable grounded atmosphere, authentic 
texture representation, scene appears as-is without mood filtering, slight underlying tension 
visible in composition but not color manipulation, ability to appreciate beauty while holding 
difficult reality.

STAKES ESCALATION: David visible sitting on "your bench" (third from entrance), posture 
suggesting difficult conversation ahead - shoulders slightly hunched, hands clasped, looking 
out at water rather than watching for your arrival. Packed duffle bag resting against bench 
(unusual - he's coming from somewhere or going somewhere?). Time pressure visible: your 
phone screen visible in foreground showing text from David: "Can we talk? Important. 3pm 
at our spot. Last chance before I decide." Moving van visible in parking area beyond bridge 
(small but noticeable detail suggesting imminent change). Spring beauty around creates 
bittersweet irony - new growth and renewal happening as relationship faces potential end. 
Dynamic elements: wind moving willow branches, flower petals drifting across path, suggesting 
time passing and change inevitable. Sense of "this moment matters" - decision point approaching.

Intimate familiar perspective showing deep shared history: approaching "your bench" from 
"your direction" (the exact route you always take), river stones you and David collected 
arranged in personal pattern on bench armrest, initials carved subtly in bench back during 
vulnerable conversation six months ago, specific knot in willow branch you've both joked 
about (looks like a face), worn path in grass from dozens of meetings, exact view you've 
both memorized and referenced in conversations. David's presence and body language readable 
because you know him deeply - can tell from posture this is serious. Maximum emotional 
weight - this isn't just a park bench, it's where your friendship with David has unfolded 
through seasons and struggles.

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation. Eye-level three-quarter view 
approaching bench, 15 feet from David (closer than typical park shots - intimate distance), 
bridge visible 50 feet beyond, standing eye level 5.5 feet height. 16:9 aspect ratio. Rule 
of thirds composition with David on bench at left third intersection, bridge at upper center, 
packed bag at lower left creating visual question. 3-layer depth: foreground (phone screen 
with text message, path leading to bench, flower petals on ground), mid-ground (David on 
bench, duffle bag, your shared personal markers), background (bridge, moving van barely 
visible, spring blossoms). Primary lighting: bright overhead spring sun creating dappled 
shadows through willow branches, secondary: reflected light from water surface, tertiary: 
ambient sky light. Clear sharp atmospheric perspective - nothing is hidden, stakes are visible 
and immediate, moment demands presence.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Bittersweet, urgent, present, weighted
- **Color Temperature**: Neutral-bright (5000K spring)
- **Saturation**: Realistic (full but not enhanced)
- **Shadow Density**: Medium (40% opacity, dappled)
- **Detail Level**: Sharp clarity, intimate distance
- **Emotional Resonance**: Urgency, bittersweet nostalgia, stakes awareness
- **Narrative Hook**: "Last chance" + moving van + serious posture = ticking clock

## Example 4: Evening | Crisis Capacity | Contradiction Moment | Level 5 (Best Friend/Soulmate)

### Context
- **Turn**: Evening (9 PM)
- **Season**: Winter
- **Player Capacity**: 0.5/10 (crisis mode, barely holding on)
- **Narrative Tension**: Contradiction Moment (David is here when he should be at his father's funeral)
- **NPC Relationship**: Level 5 (David, best friend/soulmate, you know each other's patterns and priorities completely)

### Complete Prompt

```
A landscaped urban waterfront park featuring a curved stone walking path along the river's 
edge, historic wrought-iron pedestrian bridge spanning to opposite shore, mature weeping 
willow trees creating natural canopy, ornate Victorian-era lamp posts (black with glass 
lanterns), and weathered wooden benches facing the water. River width approximately 40 feet, 
gentle current visible. Base palette: slate-gray stone path, deep green grass, black iron 
fixtures, rich brown wood benches, blue-gray water.

Deep evening darkness (astronomical twilight ending), lamp posts providing only pools of 
weak amber light (2400K) creating islands of visibility in darkness, moon not yet risen, 
sky deep indigo-black gradient, harsh contrast between illuminated and shadow areas (most 
of scene in deep shadow), river surface barely visible (only reflections of lamp light), 
cold colorless quality to artificial lighting, oppressive darkness dominating scene, light 
sources feel inadequate against overwhelming night.

Bare winter trees (willow branches stripped, hanging like skeletal fingers), no foliage 
providing any softness, frost coating every surface creating sharp crystalline edges, snow 
cover on ground (4-6 inches, disturbed by footprints), ice forming at river edges, path 
barely visible under snow, cold atmosphere radiating from scene, lamp posts have frost 
halos in cold air, breath mist heavy and visible, hostile frozen environment, winter at 
its most severe and unforgiving.

Severely desaturated palette (reduced 80% from baseline), scene appearing almost monochrome 
with only amber lamp light providing color (weak and sickly), cold blue-black tones dominating 
(9000K in shadows), oppressive atmosphere with darkness consuming most details, lamp light 
creates harsh isolated pools rather than welcoming glow, emphasize profound isolation and 
disconnection, location feels dangerous and alienating rather than restorative, foreboding 
overwhelming mood, viewer experiencing scene through lens of crisis - colors barely register, 
scene appears hostile and nightmarish, beauty completely inaccessible.

CONTRADICTION MOMENT: David is here, sitting on your bench in funeral clothing (black suit, 
loosened tie, dress shoes inadequate for snow), when he should be 300 miles away at his 
father's funeral (you know the timeline - funeral was this afternoon, reception afterward, 
he shouldn't be back until tomorrow). Visual dissonance creating intense concern: Why is 
he here? Did he not go? Did something happen? Figure hunched in lamp light, body language 
suggesting either intense cold or emotional breakdown (or both), fresh snow around bench 
suggests he's been here for extended time, no car visible in parking area (how did he get 
here?), pattern you know intimately is shattered without explanation. Your own footprints 
show desperate run through snow to reach him - you dropped everything when you saw his 
location ping. Something fundamental has broken.

Deeply personal perspective from crisis-driven approach: can barely see details through 
combination of darkness, distance, and your own crisis state, but the elements that matter 
are visible - David's silhouette in lamp light is immediately recognizable (you know his 
posture in every emotional state), "your bench" is findable in darkness because you've 
been here countless times, shared markers still visible where lamp light reaches (river 
stones, carved initials, specific willow branch), but everything is transformed by darkness 
and crisis. Location that represents your deepest friendship now feels like scene of 
disaster. Your presence everywhere (gift you gave him clutched in his hand, visible in 
lamp light, photo of you both on his phone screen illuminating his face), his presence 
here when he shouldn't be possible creates wrongness that overrides everything else.

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation, heavy atmospheric processing 
suggesting crisis perception. Eye-level rushed approach perspective, 25 feet from bench 
with David barely visible in lamp light pool, bridge completely lost in darkness behind, 
standing eye level 5.5 feet height (but perspective suggests unstable stance - crisis 
movement). 16:9 aspect ratio. Rule of thirds composition with David's illuminated figure 
at center-left third (single focal point in darkness), lamp post at upper left providing 
only light source, your disturbed footprints in snow leading from lower right. 3-layer 
depth: foreground (your frantic footprints in snow, darkness encroaching), mid-ground 
(bench with David in lamp light - island in darkness), background (complete darkness, 
bridge not visible, river not visible, world compressed to single illuminated moment). 
Lighting: single weak lamp post (2400K amber) creating harsh pool of light with sharp 
falloff, everywhere else deep blue-black shadow (9000K), no ambient light, no moon, scene 
feels like tunnel vision. Heavy atmospheric processing: peripheral darkness complete, 
vignette darkening most of frame, scene clarity maintained only in lamp light area, emotional 
distance maximized while physical presence demanded - simultaneous dissociation and hyper-focus.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Crisis, wrongness, fear, isolation, confusion
- **Color Temperature**: Extreme split (2400K weak amber / 9000K blue-black)
- **Saturation**: Severely reduced 80% (monochromatic except lamp)
- **Shadow Density**: Overwhelming (90% opacity, darkness dominant)
- **Detail Level**: Tunnel vision clarity - only lit area visible
- **Emotional Resonance**: Panic, "this shouldn't be happening", breakdown
- **Narrative Hook**: Best friend in wrong place at wrong time in crisis = violation of reality
