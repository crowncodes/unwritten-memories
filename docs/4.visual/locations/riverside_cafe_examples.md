### Complete Prompt

```
A brick-facade corner café with floor-to-ceiling windows, weathered wooden entrance door, 
and hand-painted gold lettering reading "Riverside Café". Interior visible through windows 
shows exposed brick walls, mismatched vintage chairs, and a long marble-topped bar. 
Base palette: warm terracotta brick, deep forest green awning, aged brass fixtures.

Warm amber interior lights glowing through windows contrasting sharply with cool blue 
exterior dusk (6500K), amber streetlights just activated creating pools of yellow-orange 
on pavement, gradient sky transitioning from burnt orange at horizon to deep indigo 
overhead, atmospheric twilight mood with purple-blue shadows, inviting warmth radiating 
from interior but exterior feels isolating, long shadows merging into dusk.

Warm amber and rust foliage on street trees, fallen leaves scattered across cobblestone 
pavement (burgundy, gold, brown), rich golden light from interior contrasting with cool 
exterior, slightly overcast sky diffusing remaining natural light, cozy atmosphere visible 
inside but exterior feels transitional and uncertain, bare branches beginning to show 
through thinning canopy.

Muted color saturation (reduced 25% from baseline), cooler color temperature shift in 
exterior (pushed toward blue-gray), emphasized shadows with heavier weight (60% opacity), 
more contrast between illuminated interior and darkening exterior, subtle desaturation 
of brick facade, atmospheric weight suggesting exhaustion, details remain clear but mood 
shifts decidedly toward melancholy. Interior warmth feels distant despite visibility.

MYSTERY HOOK: Unfamiliar silhouette visible in upstairs window (Sarah's apartment above 
café) - figure not recognizable, posture suggests tension or urgency. Window that is 
normally dark is illuminated with unusual blue-white light (computer screen or phone?). 
Atmospheric light fog softening street details around building, creating sense of isolation. 
Front café door slightly ajar when it should be closed for evening cleaning. Sense of 
anticipation and unease - something is happening that you're not aware of. One detail 
that raises questions without providing answers.

Familiar interior angle showing personal touches visible through main windows: your usual 
corner table (back left) marked with reserved card reading "For [Player]", photos of café 
regulars on exposed brick wall including candid shot of you and Sarah laughing, warm 
yellow-orange lighting emphasizing comfort despite exterior mood, small details showing 
regular patronage (your favorite mug on back counter, book you left behind visible on 
windowsill). Inviting but tinged with current mystery - the space you know well suddenly 
has an unexplained element.

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation. 45-degree corner view from 
street level, 30 feet from entrance, eye level 5.5 feet height, full building facade 
with 10% street context. 16:9 aspect ratio. Rule of thirds composition with café entrance 
at left third, mysterious upstairs window at upper right third intersection. 3-layer depth: 
foreground (fallen leaves on cobblestone, amber streetlight glow), mid-ground (café building 
with ground floor warmth vs. mysterious upper floor), background (deepening evening sky 
with first stars visible). Primary lighting: warm interior spill from café (3000K), secondary: 
amber streetlight (2200K), tertiary: cool blue dusk ambient (6500K). Slight atmospheric haze 
with cooler tint suggesting fatigue and uncertainty.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Melancholic, uncertain, isolated despite familiar space
- **Color Temperature**: Split (warm interior 3000K / cool exterior 6500K)
- **Saturation**: Reduced 25% (muted, drained feeling)
- **Shadow Density**: Heavy (60% opacity, merging with dusk)
- **Detail Level**: Clear but emotionally distant
- **Emotional Resonance**: Exhaustion, unease, questioning
- **Narrative Hook**: Mysterious figure + unusual light + door ajar = planted question

### Context
- **Turn**: Afternoon (2 PM)
- **Season**: Summer
- **Player Capacity**: 6.0/10 (balanced, functional but aware of stakes)

### Complete Prompt

```
A brick-facade corner café with floor-to-ceiling windows, weathered wooden entrance door, 
and hand-painted gold lettering reading "Riverside Café". Interior visible through windows 
shows exposed brick walls, mismatched vintage chairs, and a long marble-topped bar. 
Base palette: warm terracotta brick, deep forest green awning, aged brass fixtures.

Bright overhead lighting from high summer sun (60-degree angle), shorter shadows directly 
beneath architectural features, vibrant colors at peak saturation, clear brilliant blue 
sky with scattered white cumulus clouds, high-contrast definition creating sharp edges 
and dimensional depth, full illumination revealing every texture, strong golden-white 
light (5500K) creating warm but intense atmosphere.

Lush full foliage on street trees creating dappled shade on pavement, vibrant saturated 
greens, flower boxes overflowing with colorful summer blooms (red geraniums, purple petunias, 
trailing ivy), outdoor café seating populated with customers enjoying sunshine, heat shimmer 
subtly visible on distant pavement, long summer day feeling extended and full, front door 
propped open to interior showing bustling activity, awning providing shade relief.

Balanced neutral tone appropriate to medium capacity - realistic color saturation without 
enhancement or reduction, even lighting distribution showing scene as-is, comfortable but 
not idealized, authentic texture representation, grounded atmosphere. Slight tension visible 
in scene composition but not through color manipulation - the scene is beautiful but the 
stakes make it bittersweet.

STAKES ESCALATION: Professional "FOR SALE - COMMERCIAL PROPERTY" sign prominently mounted 
on corner of building (top right of frame), red and white realtor sign creating jarring 
contrast with historic brick. Heightened dramatic lighting emphasizing the urgency - strong 
summer sun creates stark shadows making the sign impossible to ignore. Visual time pressure: 
moving boxes visible through upstairs apartment window, small "OWNER RETIREMENT SALE" sandwich 
board on sidewalk with "EVERYTHING MUST GO" visible, sense of impending change and loss. 
Window poster advertising "LAST SUMMER - THANK YOU" event. Dynamic weather elements: wind 
slightly lifting awning edge, suggesting change and transition. Intensity in atmospheric 
rendering - this perfect summer day is counting down to ending.

Intimate interior details visible showing close friendship: photo collage on wall includes 
multiple images of you and Sarah (café opening day, successful events, quiet moment sharing 
coffee), your handmade gift to Sarah (ceramic planter) prominently displayed on bar, 
comfortable viewing angle from "your spot" at corner table, imperfections showing deep 
comfort (worn path on floor to your usual seat, your initials carved subtly in table edge 
from nervous fidgeting during deep conversations), warm emotional atmosphere now tinged 
with impending loss, private spaces partially visible (kitchen where you've helped during 
rushes), sense that you've been part of this place's story. Maximum emotional weight - 
this isn't just a café, it's where your friendship with Sarah solidified.

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation. 45-degree corner view from 
street level, 30 feet from entrance, eye level 5.5 feet height, full building facade 
with 10% street context. 16:9 aspect ratio. Rule of thirds composition with "FOR SALE" 
sign at upper right third intersection (impossible to miss), café entrance at left third, 
Sarah visible through window at center (mid-conversation with customer but glancing toward 
sale sign). 3-layer depth: foreground (outdoor café table with customers, sandwich board 
sign), mid-ground (café building with sale sign creating visual tension), background 
(perfect blue summer sky creating ironic beauty contrast). Primary lighting: bright overhead 
summer sun creating strong directional shadows, secondary: reflected light from adjacent 
buildings, warm interior lights visible but overpowered by daylight. Sharp atmospheric 
clarity - nothing is obscured, the stakes are clear and immediate.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Bittersweet, urgent, beautiful but threatened
- **Color Temperature**: Warm bright (5500K summer sun)
- **Saturation**: Full vibrant (peak summer)
- **Shadow Density**: Medium-strong (45% opacity, directional)
- **Detail Level**: Sharp clarity, nothing hidden
- **Emotional Resonance**: Urgency, impending loss, bittersweet nostalgia
- **Narrative Hook**: FOR SALE sign = ticking clock on friendship's sanctuary

## Example 4: Morning | Crisis Capacity | Contradiction Moment | Level 5 (Best Friend)

### Context
- **Turn**: Morning (6 AM)
- **Season**: Winter
- **Player Capacity**: 1.5/10 (crisis mode, barely functioning)
- **Narrative Tension**: Contradiction Moment (café is dark and closed when it should be opening)
- **NPC Relationship**: Level 5 (Sarah, best friend/soulmate, you know each other's patterns)

### Complete Prompt

```
A brick-facade corner café with floor-to-ceiling windows, weathered wooden entrance door, 
and hand-painted gold lettering reading "Riverside Café". Interior visible through windows 
shows exposed brick walls, mismatched vintage chairs, and a long marble-topped bar. 
Base palette: warm terracotta brick, deep forest green awning, aged brass fixtures.

Pre-dawn dim blue-gray light (weak illumination, sun not yet risen), deep shadows dominating 
scene with minimal definition, cold colorless quality to early morning, sky gradient from 
dark blue-gray at top to slightly lighter steel-blue at horizon, no warm tones present, 
harsh flat lighting creating two-dimensional feel, oppressive early morning darkness.

Bare tree branches creating stark skeletal patterns against sky, frost on café windows 
creating obscuring crystalline patterns, muted severely desaturated color palette (colors 
appear as shades of gray-blue), snow accumulation on window ledges and awning (2-3 inches), 
condensation frozen on glass preventing clear interior view, sidewalk shows packed snow 
with icy patches, cold atmosphere radiating from scene, winter dawn feels hostile and 
unforgiving.

Heavily desaturated palette (reduced 70% from baseline), cool blue-gray tones dominating 
entire scene (temperature pushed to 8000K), oppressive atmosphere with deep shadows consuming 
architectural details, windows appear uninviting and cold despite usually being warm focal 
point, emphasize isolation and disconnection, location feels distant and unreachable despite 
physical proximity, foreboding mood, colors barely registering - scene appears almost 
monochromatic with blue cast, viewer experiencing scene through fog of emotional crisis.

CONTRADICTION MOMENT: Café is completely dark inside when it should be warm and preparing 
to open (Sarah always opens at 6 AM, you've seen this ritual hundreds of times). No warm 
glow from interior, "OPEN" sign not illuminated, door clearly locked (ice buildup on handle 
suggests not opened today), no footprints in fresh snow on sidewalk leading to entrance. 
Sarah's apartment upstairs is also dark (no lights, curtains drawn - highly unusual). Visual 
dissonance creating intense intrigue: the pattern you know intimately is broken without 
explanation. Something fundamental has shifted. Viewer positioned as someone who knows this 
is wrong - normal morning routine violently disrupted. Your own footprints in snow show 
you've approached and stopped, uncertain.

Deeply personal perspective showing maximum intimacy now violated by absence. Interior 
details barely visible through frosted windows but include: framed photo of you and Sarah 
visible on back wall (your faces obscured by frost), coffee maker that should be steaming 
is cold and dark, Sarah's coat hook empty when she always arrives early and hangs coat 
first thing, your special mug sitting empty on counter where she usually prepares your 
"sunrise coffee" before you arrive. Location rendered as sanctuary now feeling abandoned - 
your presence is everywhere (spare key she gave you in your pocket, gift you made her 
visible through frost, your handwriting on menu board from last time you helped) but her 
absence is overwhelming. Cherished details that should be comforting now amplify wrongness. 
Where is she?

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation, heavy atmospheric processing 
suggesting crisis perception. 45-degree corner view from street level, 30 feet from entrance, 
eye level 5.5 feet height, full building facade with 10% street context. 16:9 aspect ratio. 
Rule of thirds composition with dark café entrance at left third (usually warm focal point, 
now void), dark upstairs window at upper right third (should show Sarah's morning activity), 
your footprints in snow leading to locked door at center bottom. 3-layer depth: foreground 
(your footprints in pristine snow, showing approach and hesitation), mid-ground (dark 
lifeless café building - contradiction made physical), background (cold steel-blue winter 
dawn sky, indifferent to crisis). Lighting: weak pre-dawn ambient only (7500K), no warm 
sources present, blue-gray cast throughout, scene feels drained of life. Heavy atmospheric 
processing: slight blur at edges of vision suggesting dissociation, vignette darkening 
peripheral vision, scene clarity maintained but emotional distance maximized - looking at 
sanctuary that suddenly feels alien.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Crisis, abandonment, wrongness, dissociation
- **Color Temperature**: Cold harsh (7500K-8000K blue-gray)
- **Saturation**: Severely reduced 70% (nearly monochromatic)
- **Shadow Density**: Oppressive (80% opacity, consuming details)
- **Detail Level**: Technically clear but emotionally distant
- **Emotional Resonance**: Panic, absence, pattern violation, "something is very wrong"
- **Narrative Hook**: Best friend's expected pattern broken = immediate crisis concern

## Example 5: Afternoon | High Capacity | Partial Reveal | Level 2 (Acquaintance)

### Context
- **Turn**: Afternoon (4 PM)
- **Season**: Spring
- **Player Capacity**: 8.5/10 (energized, socially engaged, curious)
- **Narrative Tension**: Partial Reveal (renovation supplies visible, but no explanation)
- **NPC Relationship**: Level 2 (acquaintance, visited 8-10 times, know barista's name)

### Complete Prompt

```
A brick-facade corner café with floor-to-ceiling windows, weathered wooden entrance door, 
and hand-painted gold lettering reading "Riverside Café". Interior visible through windows 
shows exposed brick walls, mismatched vintage chairs, and a long marble-topped bar. 
Base palette: warm terracotta brick, deep forest green awning, aged brass fixtures.

Bright afternoon overhead lighting, shorter shadows directly beneath features, vibrant 
colors at peak saturation, clear sky with scattered white clouds, high-contrast definition, 
full illumination revealing textures and details, warm golden quality to sunlight (4500K) 
despite overhead angle, sense of active bustling afternoon energy.

Fresh green foliage on street trees with new leaves, flower boxes showing mix of early 
and mid-spring blooms (daffodils fading, tulips at peak, early roses budding), recent 
rain has cleaned surfaces creating slight sheen, soft diffused quality to light through 
scattered clouds, occasional shadow from passing clouds creating dynamic lighting, puddles 
drying on sidewalk, sense of transition and growth, mild pleasant temperature suggested 
by open windows and outdoor seating occupied.

Crisp sharp details throughout, vibrant saturated colors, inviting warm atmosphere, clear 
atmospheric perspective showing depth, welcoming ambiance emphasized, positive architectural 
features highlighted, slight glow to warm interior lights visible through windows, optimistic 
color grading with lifted highlights, sense of pleasant discovery and engagement, world 
feels open and full of possibility.

PARTIAL REVEAL: Show effect without explaining cause. Stacks of paint cans visible inside 
front window (new colors? renovation?), drop cloths partially covering some furniture, 
ladder leaned against interior wall, section of wall showing new paint sample swatches 
(3-4 different colors tested), but café is still fully operational and no explanation visible. 
Construction permits posted in window but details not readable from viewing distance. 
Create "information debt" - promise of future explanation. Sarah (barista) visible through 
window in conversation with person in contractor-style clothing, both gesturing at walls, 
but you can't hear conversation. Sense of significant change happening that you're not 
part of yet - as acquaintance, you're not in the loop. What's happening? Is this good or 
concerning? Scene raises questions without providing answers.

Interior glimpse through windows showing general layout and some personality hints: can 
see overall décor style (vintage eclectic, warm tones, lots of plants), photos and artwork 
on walls but not close enough to see details clearly, comfortable viewing angle from public 
space, inviting but not intimate. The renovation supplies suggest depth you haven't been 
privy to - there's a story here you're not part of. Professional presentation with hints 
of personal touches. "OPEN" sign and menu board visible, customers present but you don't 
recognize anyone specifically.

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation. 45-degree corner view from 
street level, 30 feet from entrance, eye level 5.5 feet height, full building facade 
with 10% street context. 16:9 aspect ratio. Rule of thirds composition with café entrance 
at left third, visible paint supplies and Sarah+contractor conversation at center, exterior 
seating at right third. 3-layer depth: foreground (cobblestone pavement with drying puddles, 
outdoor café table with customers), mid-ground (café building with mysterious renovation 
activity), background (spring sky with dynamic cloud shadows). Primary lighting: bright 
afternoon sun from upper right, secondary: reflected light from wet pavement and adjacent 
buildings, warm interior lights visible but subtle against daylight. Clear atmospheric 
perspective with slight spring haze suggesting pleasant mild weather.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Curious, engaged, pleasant mystery
- **Color Temperature**: Warm bright (4500K spring afternoon)
- **Saturation**: High vibrant (energized perception)
- **Shadow Density**: Medium (35% opacity, natural)
- **Detail Level**: High clarity with tantalizing obscured details
- **Emotional Resonance**: Curiosity, pleasant anticipation, mild FOMO
- **Narrative Hook**: Visible renovation without explanation = planted curiosity
