### Complete Prompt

```
A cozy 400-square-foot studio apartment with exposed brick wall (left side), large bay 
window with built-in window seat (facing east), hardwood floors (honey-colored oak with 
visible grain), open galley kitchen with white subway tile backsplash, vintage brass light 
fixtures, and plants on every available surface. Distinctive features: hexagonal floor tiles 
in kitchen area, macramé plant hangers, floor-to-ceiling bookshelf (right wall, painted 
sage green), small dining table with mismatched chairs. Base palette: warm honey wood floors, 
terracotta brick, sage green accents, cream walls, brass fixtures.

Bright morning sunlight streaming through bay window, creating strong directional golden 
light (3800K) across room, long shadows extending from furniture westward, window seat 
bathed in warm glow, rest of room partially in shadow creating dramatic light-dark contrast, 
dust motes visible in sunbeams, brass fixtures reflecting light creating warm sparkles, 
hardwood floor glowing warm amber in direct light, sense of fresh morning energy and clarity.

Spring atmosphere: fresh flowers on dining table (tulips, just purchased), new green growth 
visible on houseplants, window cracked open showing sheer white curtains billowing gently, 
fresh air quality, mild temperature suggested by light cardigan draped on chair, sense of 
renewal and growth, morning sounds from open window (birds, distant traffic), connection 
to outside world maintained.

Crisp sharp details throughout scene, vibrant saturated colors, inviting warm atmosphere, 
clear definition of all elements, welcoming ambiance emphasized, morning light highlighting 
positive details (plant health, clean surfaces, organized space), optimistic color grading 
with lifted highlights, sense of pleasant discovery, space feels open and energizing.

Clean authentic representation with no narrative tension. Apartment in "company ready" 
state - tidy, organized, presentable but not deeply personal, space shows personality through 
general aesthetic choices (book genres visible, plant collection, art style) but not intimate 
details, focus on welcoming atmosphere and beauty, sense of Sarah as thoughtful host.

General acquaintance perspective showing public/guest-appropriate view: can see overall 
layout and design aesthetic, some personality hints visible (photography prints on walls 
- abstract cityscapes, collection of vintage cameras on bookshelf, cookbook titles suggesting 
cooking interest) but no deeply personal items visible. Window seat has neutral cushions 
and throw pillows. Bookshelf shows organized categories but titles not readable from this 
distance. Kitchen shows quality but not personal cooking habits. Observer positioned as 
invited guest seeing public presentation of space - comfortable but maintaining appropriate 
boundaries.

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation. Three-quarter view from entryway 
perspective, 8 feet into room from doorway, standing eye level 5.5 feet height. 16:9 aspect 
ratio. Rule of thirds composition with bay window at right third (primary light source and 
visual anchor), dining table at center, bookshelf at right edge, kitchen visible at left 
third. 3-layer depth: foreground (entryway area, hardwood floor detail, shoes by door), 
mid-ground (dining table, living area furniture, plants), background (bay window with 
morning light, window seat, city view beyond). Primary lighting: strong directional morning 
sun through bay window (3800K), secondary: overhead brass fixture (off but visible), 
tertiary: reflected light from honey floors. Clean atmospheric clarity with soft morning haze 
suggesting pleasant spring temperature.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Welcoming, curious, appropriate boundaries
- **Color Temperature**: Warm golden (3800K morning sun)
- **Saturation**: High vibrant (energized perception)
- **Shadow Density**: Medium-strong (45% opacity, dramatic but pleasant)
- **Detail Level**: Clear but public-appropriate distance
- **Emotional Resonance**: Pleasant discovery, appropriate social distance

## Example 2: Evening | Low Capacity | Mystery Hook | Level 3 (Friend)

### Context
- **Turn**: Evening (8 PM)
- **Season**: Fall
- **Player Capacity**: 3.0/10 (exhausted, seeking comfort)
- **Narrative Tension**: Mystery Hook (Sarah's usually organized space is chaotic, she's vague about why)

### Complete Prompt

```
A cozy 400-square-foot studio apartment with exposed brick wall (left side), large bay 
window with built-in window seat (facing east), hardwood floors (honey-colored oak with 
visible grain), open galley kitchen with white subway tile backsplash, vintage brass light 
fixtures, and plants on every available surface. Distinctive features: hexagonal floor tiles 
in kitchen area, macramé plant hangers, floor-to-ceiling bookshelf (right wall, painted 
sage green), small dining table with mismatched chairs. Base palette: warm honey wood floors, 
terracotta brick, sage green accents, cream walls, brass fixtures.

Warm interior lighting only (no natural light, full darkness outside), overhead brass 
fixtures casting pools of amber-yellow light (2700K) creating intimate but slightly harsh 
atmosphere, window reflecting interior as dark mirror (no view out, just reflection), 
shadows deep and dramatic in corners, contrast between illuminated and shadow areas creating 
divided feeling to space, some areas inadequately lit (desk lamp out/off when usually on), 
sense of disconnection from outside world, night pressing against windows.

Fall evening atmosphere: window closed against chill (unusual - Sarah typically loves 
fresh air), condensation on window glass suggesting temperature differential, dying leaves 
visible on some houseplants (neglect - very unusual for Sarah), fall jacket thrown over 
chair rather than hung, space feels slightly stuffy without air circulation, sense of 
withdrawn isolation from season outside.

Muted color saturation (reduced 30% from baseline), cooler color temperature in shadows 
despite warm light sources, emphasized shadows creating heavier atmosphere (60% opacity), 
more contrast between lit and dark areas creating divided feeling, subtle desaturation 
making familiar space feel slightly off, atmospheric weight suggesting fatigue, details 
clear but scene has underlying heaviness, familiar comfort harder to access through 
exhaustion lens.

MYSTERY HOOK: Sarah's normally organized space shows unusual chaos that she hasn't explained: 
stack of moving boxes (empty? full? can't tell) partially blocking bookshelf, several books 
pulled from shelves and stacked on floor (mid-project?), dining table covered with papers 
and laptop (normally kept clear), window seat cushions removed and stacked (redecorating? 
packing?), framed photos that usually hang on exposed brick are leaned against wall 
(changing arrangement or removing?). Sarah was vague when you asked, deflected to other 
topics, but invited you over anyway (why show you this?). Suitcase visible at edge of frame 
(partially hidden behind door - recently used or about to use?). Coffee table has multiple 
coffee mugs (unusual - she's tidy). Sense of transition or disruption with no explanation 
provided. What's happening? Is she okay?

Familiar friend perspective showing you know this space well: can see the differences from 
normal state (desk usually clear, books alphabetized, window seat always set up, no clutter), 
your contributions to space visible (throw pillow you gave her - now on floor in chaos, 
book you lent her - part of floor stack, photo of you both - one of those leaning against 
wall), comfortable viewing angle from "your usual spot" where you'd stand when arriving, 
personal markers showing regular presence (your favorite mug visible in dish rack, spare 
phone charger you leave here plugged in at usual spot), but current chaos disrupts familiar 
comfort creating unease.

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation. Three-quarter view from entryway 
perspective, 8 feet into room from doorway, standing eye level 5.5 feet height. 16:9 aspect 
ratio. Rule of thirds composition with chaotic dining table at center (visual focal point 
showing disruption), mysterious boxes blocking bookshelf at right third, window as dark 
mirror at upper right. 3-layer depth: foreground (entryway with partially hidden suitcase, 
your shoes next to hers by door), mid-ground (cluttered living space, visible chaos, removed 
photos), background (dark window reflection, blocked bookshelf, kitchen with multiple mugs). 
Primary lighting: overhead brass fixtures (2700K amber) creating pools of light, secondary: 
desk lamp (off - unusual), tertiary: reflected light from wood floors. Atmospheric processing: 
slight muting of colors, heavier shadows, sense of familiar space disrupted creating unease.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Uneasy, concerned, familiar-but-wrong
- **Color Temperature**: Warm isolated (2700K interior only)
- **Saturation**: Reduced 30% (drained feeling)
- **Shadow Density**: Heavy (60% opacity)
- **Detail Level**: Clear with recognizable disruption
- **Emotional Resonance**: Confusion, concern for friend
- **Narrative Hook**: Unexplained chaos in organized friend's space = planted question

- **Season**: Summer
- **Player Capacity**: 6.0/10 (functional, emotionally available)

### Complete Prompt

```
A cozy 400-square-foot studio apartment with exposed brick wall (left side), large bay 
window with built-in window seat (facing east), hardwood floors (honey-colored oak with 
visible grain), open galley kitchen with white subway tile backsplash, vintage brass light 
fixtures, and plants on every available surface. Distinctive features: hexagonal floor tiles 
in kitchen area, macramé plant hangers, floor-to-ceiling bookshelf (right wall, painted 
sage green), small dining table with mismatched chairs. Base palette: warm honey wood floors, 
terracotta brick, sage green accents, cream walls, brass fixtures.

Bright afternoon overhead light through bay window, sun high creating even illumination 
across space, clear sharp lighting (5500K) revealing every detail without harsh shadows, 
sense of exposure and clarity - nothing hidden, no atmospheric softness, functional direct 
light appropriate to serious conversation, occasional cloud shadow moving across room 
suggesting time passing, brass fixtures off (unnecessary with daylight), sense of suspended 
moment in otherwise active day.

Peak summer atmosphere: window open with sheer curtains pulled fully back (no hiding), 
houseplants at maximum health (lush, vibrant - normally comforting but now feels ironic), 
city sounds from window (traffic, construction, life continuing), warm air creating slight 
heat shimmer effect near window, sense of life peak and abundance that contrasts with 
current stakes, beauty present but secondary to present moment weight.

Balanced neutral tone appropriate to medium capacity: realistic color saturation, even 
lighting without mood enhancement, authentic representation, comfortable grounded atmosphere 
able to hold difficult reality, no filtering - seeing scene as it is, slight underlying 
tension visible in careful composition but not through color manipulation, capacity to 
appreciate beauty while holding difficult conversation.

STAKES ESCALATION: Visible evidence of major life decision in progress. Dining table has 
two sets of documents spread out: (A) job offer letter with letterhead visible "Seattle 
Tech Company" and (B) lease renewal document with "DECISION DEADLINE: AUGUST 1" clearly 
visible. Calendar on wall shows today's date circled in red with "FINAL DECISION" written. 
Laptop open showing apartment listings in Seattle. Phone on table shows text chain with 
frequent mentions of "opportunity" and "sacrifice." Pro/con list in Sarah's handwriting 
visible with your name appearing multiple times under both columns. Time pressure explicit: 
deadline is days away. Window view shows the city she might be leaving. Two coffee mugs 
on table - she's been waiting for you, this conversation is the decision point. Stakes 
visible and immediate: her choice will fundamentally affect your friendship. Your presence 
matters to her decision process - you're in both columns of pros/cons.

Intimate close-friend perspective showing deep integration into her life: viewing angle 
from "your chair" at dining table (the mismatched blue one she got specifically because 
you liked it), your influence visible throughout space (books you recommended filling 
bookshelf sections, art print you gave her hanging in place of honor, your spare clothes 
visible in open closet, your contributions to her plant collection thriving, your handwriting 
on shopping list on fridge, photo of you both in matching frames at her bedside and your 
bedside at home), space reflects your friendship deeply, imperfections showing ultimate 
comfort (your mess on her coffee table, shared meal dishes still in sink from last night, 
your project supplies using her desk), maximum emotional investment - this space represents 
countless hours of your life, and her decision will determine if these patterns continue 
or end.

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation. Three-quarter view from entryway 
but angle suggests movement toward your usual chair, 8 feet into room from doorway with 
clear view of decision documents on table, standing eye level 5.5 feet height. 16:9 aspect 
ratio. Rule of thirds composition with decision documents at center focal point (unavoidable), 
Sarah visible at bay window looking out at city (her back to camera - contemplating), your 
chair waiting at lower left third. 3-layer depth: foreground (your chair, your belongings 
scattered showing presence), mid-ground (table with decision materials, evidence of your 
importance in both directions), background (Sarah at window, city beyond, future in question). 
Primary lighting: bright overhead summer sun through bay window creating even clear light, 
secondary: reflected light from honey floors, tertiary: ambient from cream walls. Sharp 
atmospheric clarity - nothing softened, stakes are visible and real, moment demands full 
presence and difficult truth.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Serious, weighted, bittersweet, present
- **Color Temperature**: Neutral-bright (5500K summer)
- **Saturation**: Realistic (full but unenhanced)
- **Shadow Density**: Light-medium (30% opacity, minimal)
- **Detail Level**: Sharp clarity, intimate close distance
- **Emotional Resonance**: Stakes awareness, bittersweet, decisional weight
- **Narrative Hook**: Decision deadline + your importance to both sides = ticking clock on friendship

## Example 4: Evening | Crisis Capacity | Partial Reveal | Level 5 (Best Friend/Chosen Family)

### Context
- **Turn**: Evening (11 PM)
- **Season**: Winter
- **Player Capacity**: 1.0/10 (crisis mode, came here as only safe space)
- **Narrative Tension**: Partial Reveal (evidence of Sarah's own crisis you weren't aware of)
- **NPC Relationship**: Level 5 (best friend/chosen family, you have keys, this is second home)

### Complete Prompt

```
A cozy 400-square-foot studio apartment with exposed brick wall (left side), large bay 
window with built-in window seat (facing east), hardwood floors (honey-colored oak with 
visible grain), open galley kitchen with white subway tile backsplash, vintage brass light 
fixtures, and plants on every available surface. Distinctive features: hexagonal floor tiles 
in kitchen area, macramé plant hangers, floor-to-ceiling bookshelf (right wall, painted 
sage green), small dining table with mismatched chairs. Base palette: warm honey wood floors, 
terracotta brick, sage green accents, cream walls, brass fixtures.

Single desk lamp providing only light source (weak warm glow, 2400K, inadequate for space), 
overhead fixtures off, most of apartment in deep shadow, window showing city lights outside 
but appearing cold and distant against interior darkness, harsh contrast between single 
lit area and surrounding darkness, brass fixtures barely visible in gloom, floor disappearing 
into shadow at edges, sense of compressed space - darkness making studio feel smaller and 
more confined, oppressive late-night isolation despite being in city.

Deep winter night: window frost creating obscuring patterns, cold air seeping from window 
frame visible as slight condensation, houseplants showing winter stress (some browning, 
drooping - unusual neglect), radiator visible but clearly inadequate (extra blankets 
everywhere suggesting cold), season's harshness penetrating supposedly safe interior space, 
sense of being besieged by winter, life struggling rather than thriving.

Severely desaturated palette (reduced 75% from baseline), scene appearing nearly monochrome 
except weak warm desk lamp (creating sickly yellow pool), cold blue-black tones in shadows 
(8500K), oppressive atmosphere with darkness dominating, single light source inadequate 
creating feeling of depression/scarcity rather than intimate coziness, emphasize isolation 
and disconnection, familiar space transformed into crisis refuge, foreboding weight, colors 
barely registering through crisis lens, comfort beauty completely inaccessible despite this 
being "home," space reflects your interior state - barely functioning, holding on.

PARTIAL REVEAL: You came here in crisis seeking safety, let yourself in with your key 
expecting empty apartment (Sarah works late Thursdays). But signs of Sarah's hidden crisis 
visible: pill bottles on counter (anxiety medication? antidepressants? you didn't know she 
was struggling), therapist business card propped against mirror (new? you had no idea she 
needed help), tissues overflowing small trash can, laptop open showing "Crisis Helpline" 
tab, journal left open on window seat with your name visible multiple times (she's been 
writing about your friendship but never mentioned struggling), blanket nest on floor rather 
than bed suggesting she's not sleeping properly. You came here as safe harbor in YOUR crisis 
but suddenly realize she's been having her own crisis she hasn't shared. Role reversal 
creating complicated emotions: guilt (you missed this), concern (how bad is it?), betrayal 
(why didn't she tell you?), uncertainty (can this space be refuge when she needs refuge too?). 
Show effect without cause - evidence of struggle without explanation. Sarah not home yet 
but will arrive soon (her shift ends in 20 minutes). What do you do with this knowledge?

Deeply personal intimate perspective from crisis arrival: you're viewing space from "your 
spot" on her floor (where you sit when you need to feel small and safe), can see everything 
that makes this second home (your toothbrush by hers, your clothes in her closet equal to 
hers, your books integrated completely with hers on shelves, shared meals in fridge with 
notes in both handwritings, photos of you both everywhere including matching friendship 
tattoos visible in framed photo, your artwork on her walls and hers on yours at your place, 
your spare key on her key ring on hook, her spare on yours), maximum integration and 
enmeshment - you're chosen family, this space is mutual home. But current discovery disrupts 
that safety: the evidence of her hidden struggle shows distance you didn't know existed. 
Your presence everywhere makes discovery more painful - you're THIS integrated and you 
missed it. Perfect comfort and perfect disruption coexisting.

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation, heavy atmospheric processing 
suggesting crisis perception. View from floor level (sitting/collapsed position - different 
from all other examples), 5 feet into room, eye level 3 feet height (sitting on floor with 
back against exposed brick wall - "your spot"). 16:9 aspect ratio. Rule of thirds composition 
with desk lamp and pill bottles at upper right third (evidence of her crisis), your backpack 
dropped at lower left (evidence of your crisis), window with city lights at upper center 
(world continuing, indifferent). 3-layer depth: foreground (your presence on floor, your 
belongings dropped in crisis arrival, view from lowest vulnerable position), mid-ground 
(evidence of Sarah's struggle visible in lamp light, intimate space showing both your lives 
completely integrated), background (dark cold window, city beyond, isolation despite proximity 
to others). Lighting: single weak desk lamp (2400K) providing inadequate pool of light, 
everywhere else in deep shadow, phone screen in your hand providing secondary blue light 
(6500K) on your face, scene feels like tunnel vision with peripheral darkness. Heavy 
atmospheric processing: extreme vignette, clarity only in central island of lamp light, 
scene perceived through crisis dissociation - simultaneous hyper-awareness of specific 
details (pill bottles, journal) and complete disconnection from overall space.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Crisis layered on crisis, betrayal mixed with concern
- **Color Temperature**: Extreme split (2400K weak / 8500K shadows)
- **Saturation**: Severely reduced 75% (monochrome except lamp)
- **Shadow Density**: Overwhelming (85% opacity)
- **Detail Level**: Tunnel vision - specific details hyper-visible, periphery lost
- **Emotional Resonance**: Crisis, guilt, concern, role confusion, comfort violated
- **Narrative Hook**: Best friend's hidden crisis discovered during your crisis = complex layered tension
