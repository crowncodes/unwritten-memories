A modern open-plan tech office occupying the 14th floor of a glass-facade building, featuring 
floor-to-ceiling windows with panoramic city views, exposed concrete ceiling with visible 
ductwork painted matte black, polished concrete floors, standing desk clusters (6 desks per 
pod with privacy screens), central collaboration zone with modular seating (bright yellow 
and teal accent colors), glass-walled conference rooms along perimeter, and abundant 
hanging plants. Distinctive features: feature wall with company logo (geometric mountain 
design in teal), espresso bar with industrial aesthetic, acoustic ceiling baffles in coral 
color. Base palette: cool gray concrete, matte black ceiling elements, teal and yellow 
accents, natural wood desk surfaces, white privacy screens.

Bright morning sunlight flooding through east-facing windows, creating dramatic long shadows 
westward across polished concrete floor, sun angle (25 degrees) creating warm golden glow 
(3600K) that contrasts beautifully with cool industrial materials, city visible beyond 
windows bathed in morning light, glass surfaces reflecting and refracting light creating 
dynamic sparkles, overhead LED panels (5000K) barely needed with abundant natural light, 
sense of energy and beginning, fresh start atmosphere.

Spring morning atmosphere: windows show city trees with fresh green leaves, clear blue sky 
visible beyond buildings, occasional cloud shadow moving across office space, mild temperature 
perfect for productivity (light layers visible on workers), plants throughout space showing 
healthy spring growth, sense of renewal and possibility, morning coffee aroma from espresso 
bar, early arrivals settling into day with friendly energy.

Crisp sharp details throughout scene, vibrant saturated colors (teal and yellow accents 
particularly vivid), inviting energetic atmosphere, clear definition of all elements, 
welcoming professional ambiance emphasized, morning light highlighting positive features 
(modern design, collaborative spaces, natural elements), optimistic color grading with 
lifted highlights, sense of exciting discovery, space feels full of opportunity and potential.

Clean authentic representation with no narrative tension. Office in morning startup mode - 
people arriving, settling in, casual conversations at espresso bar, collaborative energy 
beginning to build, space shows professional culture through general activity patterns 
(casual dress, friendly interactions, relaxed but productive vibe), focus on welcoming 
atmosphere and potential, sense of belonging within reach.

First-day newcomer perspective showing appropriate professional distance: viewing angle 
from main entrance where HR just left you ("Alex will be right with you"), can see overall 
layout and impressive design, some cultural hints visible (casual dress code, collaborative 
setup, tech-forward environment, pride in space design) but no personal details yet. Desk 
pods visible but you don't know which will be yours. Conference rooms show scheduled meetings 
on digital displays but you're not in any yet. Espresso bar has people but you don't know 
anyone to join. Observer positioned as newcomer seeing public presentation of company 
culture - excited but not yet integrated, evaluating if this lives up to interview promises.

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation. Three-quarter view from main 
entrance corridor, 25 feet into office space, standing eye level 5.5 feet height. 16:9 
aspect ratio. Rule of thirds composition with teal logo wall at left third (company identity 
focal point), collaboration zone with yellow-teal seating at center, panoramic windows and 
city view at right third and background. 3-layer depth: foreground (polished concrete floor 
reflecting morning light, corridor threshold), mid-ground (desk pods with early arrivals, 
espresso bar activity, collaboration zone), background (windows with city view, morning 
sky, sense of height and possibility). Primary lighting: strong directional morning sun 
through east windows (3600K golden), secondary: overhead LED panels (5000K cool white, 
supplemental), tertiary: reflected light from polished concrete floor. Clean atmospheric 
clarity with slight morning haze suggesting fresh spring air circulation.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Excited, optimistic, evaluative, first-day energy
- **Color Temperature**: Mixed warm-cool (3600K natural / 5000K LED)
- **Saturation**: High vibrant (energized perception, accent colors pop)
- **Shadow Density**: Medium (40% opacity, dramatic but pleasant)
- **Detail Level**: Clear comprehensive overview
- **Emotional Resonance**: Possibility, new beginnings, slight nervous excitement

## Example 2: Afternoon | Low Capacity | Mystery Hook | Level 3 (Colleague/Friend)

### Context
- **Turn**: Afternoon (2 PM)
- **Season**: Summer
- **Player Capacity**: 3.5/10 (exhausted from deadline crunch, burned out)
- **Narrative Tension**: Mystery Hook (Alex suddenly called into closed-door meeting, unusual serious atmosphere)
- **NPC Relationship**: Level 3 (Alex is work friend, 4 months of daily collaboration, lunch buddies)

```
A modern open-plan tech office occupying the 14th floor of a glass-facade building, featuring 
floor-to-ceiling windows with panoramic city views, exposed concrete ceiling with visible 
ductwork painted matte black, polished concrete floors, standing desk clusters (6 desks per 
pod with privacy screens), central collaboration zone with modular seating (bright yellow 
and teal accent colors), glass-walled conference rooms along perimeter, and abundant 
hanging plants. Distinctive features: feature wall with company logo (geometric mountain 
design in teal), espresso bar with industrial aesthetic, acoustic ceiling baffles in coral 
color. Base palette: cool gray concrete, matte black ceiling elements, teal and yellow 
accents, natural wood desk surfaces, white privacy screens.

Harsh overhead LED lighting (5500K) with no natural light relief (window shades partially 
lowered due to afternoon glare), flat even illumination creating minimal shadows and 
two-dimensional quality, sun position creating blinding glare on screens requiring shades, 
artificial lighting dominance creating sterile atmosphere despite modern design, contrast 
between bright work areas and darker peripheral zones, sense of disconnection from outside 
world despite windows, oppressive afternoon energy slump atmosphere.

Peak summer heat visible: AC vents working hard (papers fluttering slightly), people in 
minimal professional clothing, water bottles everywhere, window shades drawn against brutal 
afternoon sun reducing inspiring city views, plants showing slight heat stress (drooping 
despite watering), sense of environmental siege, trapped inside during beautiful weather, 
heat shimmer visible on roof surfaces outside windows when shades gap, long exhausting 
summer afternoon feeling endless.

Muted color saturation (reduced 35% from baseline), cooler color temperature in perception 
despite neutral lighting, emphasized contrast between bright work zones and darker edges, 
more visual weight to shadows and dim areas, subtle desaturation making normally vibrant 
accent colors feel dull, atmospheric heaviness suggesting exhaustion, details clear but 
scene has grinding tired quality, collaborative energy feels depleted, space that should 
inspire feels demanding.

MYSTERY HOOK: Alex's desk (in your shared pod of 6) is abandoned mid-task - coffee still 
steaming, laptop open with Slack messages piling up unread, phone face-down (he never does 
that), noise-canceling headphones left mid-meeting (unprofessional - very unlike him). Alex 
was urgently called into perimeter conference room 15 minutes ago by senior leadership 
(visible through glass wall but blinds now drawn - highly unusual), several executives 
arrived just before (also unusual - they're rarely on this floor), serious closed-door 
atmosphere completely counter to normal open culture. His calendar shows nothing scheduled. 
Other colleagues in your pod exchanging glances but saying nothing. Your shared project has 
major presentation tomorrow - his absence concerning. What's happening? Is it performance 
review? Layoffs? Promotion? Something personal? Atmosphere of unspoken tension in normally 
relaxed space.

Familiar colleague perspective from your desk (directly adjacent to Alex's in 6-person pod): 
viewing angle from your chair where you've sat daily for 4 months, can see your work setup 
(dual monitors with your desktop visible, personal coffee mug - gift from Alex with inside 
joke, photo of your team at offsite on your desk, your messy notes), Alex's desk intimately 
familiar (his organization system, his stickers on laptop, his specific snack drawer 
arrangement, project files you're both working on, shared whiteboard with both your 
handwriting), pod shows 4-month working relationship (collaborative notes, inside jokes on 
privacy screens, your lunch spot routine visible through established patterns), but current 
mystery disrupts familiar comfort - something unknown is happening to your friend.

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation. View from your desk chair 
(seated position - different from standing entry view), 6 feet from Alex's empty desk, 
eye level 4 feet height (seated), angled to see both your workspace and his abandonment. 
16:9 aspect ratio. Rule of thirds composition with Alex's abandoned desk at center-left 
focal point (steaming coffee, open laptop, unread messages), closed-door conference room 
with drawn blinds at right third background (mystery location), your shared project materials 
at lower right (stakes visible). 3-layer depth: foreground (your desk space showing your 
presence and connection), mid-ground (Alex's suddenly empty desk, other podmates continuing 
work but tense), background (mysterious conference room, partial city view through lowered 
shades, heat shimmer). Primary lighting: flat overhead LED (5500K) creating even but harsh 
illumination, secondary: individual desk lamps providing small warm zones, tertiary: limited 
natural light through shade gaps. Atmospheric processing: muted colors suggesting exhaustion, 
heavier visual weight to contrast areas, scene has grinding tired quality with mystery 
tension layered on top.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Exhausted, concerned, tense, mystery creating unease
- **Color Temperature**: Cool neutral (5500K LED, sterile)
- **Saturation**: Reduced 35% (burnout perception, colors dull)
- **Shadow Density**: Light but harsh (30% opacity, flat lighting)
- **Detail Level**: Intimate workspace detail, familiar patterns disrupted
- **Emotional Resonance**: Exhaustion compounded by concern for friend
- **Narrative Hook**: Urgent closed-door meeting + abandoned desk + unusual leadership presence = planted question

## Example 3: Evening | Medium Capacity | Stakes Escalation | Level 4 (Close Friend/Work Partner)

### Context
- **Turn**: Evening (7 PM)
- **Season**: Fall
- **Player Capacity**: 5.5/10 (tired but functional, deadline approaching)
- **Narrative Tension**: Stakes Escalation (project presentation tomorrow, Alex considering leaving company)
- **NPC Relationship**: Level 4 (close friend, work partner, 8 months of intense collaboration, trust deeply)

### Complete Prompt

```
A modern open-plan tech office occupying the 14th floor of a glass-facade building, featuring 
floor-to-ceiling windows with panoramic city views, exposed concrete ceiling with visible 
ductwork painted matte black, polished concrete floors, standing desk clusters (6 desks per 
pod with privacy screens), central collaboration zone with modular seating (bright yellow 
and teal accent colors), glass-walled conference rooms along perimeter, and abundant 
hanging plants. Distinctive features: feature wall with company logo (geometric mountain 
design in teal), espresso bar with industrial aesthetic, acoustic ceiling baffles in coral 
color. Base palette: cool gray concrete, matte black ceiling elements, teal and yellow 
accents, natural wood desk surfaces, white privacy screens.

Interior lighting only (dark outside, sun set 90 minutes ago), overhead LEDs dimmed to 
60% for evening (4000K warmer setting), desk lamps providing pools of focused work light 
(3000K warm), city lights visible through windows creating beautiful but isolating backdrop, 
office feels like island of activity in sea of night, dramatic contrast between lit interior 
workspace and dark surroundings, shadows deeper and more present, atmospheric quality 
suggesting long workday extending into evening, sense of dedicated few remaining.

Fall evening atmosphere visible through windows: city lights reflect off early evening rain 
on glass, bare branches visible on street trees below, darker earlier than summer (visible 
time progression to those working long hours), cooler temperature suggested by people in 
layers (hoodies, cardigans), sense of season transition matching life transition, outside 
world continuing while you're still working, isolation of evening work session.

Balanced neutral tone appropriate to medium capacity: realistic color saturation, even 
warm lighting creating comfortable work atmosphere, authentic representation of evening 
workspace, grounded functional mood, no dramatic filtering, slight underlying tension 
visible in careful composition but not through color manipulation, capacity to maintain 
productivity while holding difficult situation, world appears as it is.

STAKES ESCALATION: Office nearly empty (most people gone by 6pm), only your pod active - 
just you and Alex remaining for deadline prep. Evidence of major decision in progress visible: 
Alex's desk has printed job offer from competitor company (you can see letterhead), his 
resignation letter draft visible on second monitor (he thinks you don't notice angle lets 
you see), calendar showing tomorrow's project presentation (your joint 8-month effort), 
LinkedIn open on his phone with "Update Profile" notification. Time pressure explicit: 
presentation is 9am tomorrow (12 hours away), his decision appears to be: present your 
joint work then resign, or resign before presentation. Stakes visible: his choice affects 
your project (it's both your work), your professional reputation (you're co-leads), and 
your friendship (you've built this together). Whiteboard between your desks shows project 
timeline with both your contributions - inseparable partnership. His posture suggests 
internal struggle - he wants to tell you but hasn't yet. Your partnership at inflection point.

Deep work-partnership perspective from adjacent desk in your intimate pod: viewing angle 
from "your station" in shared 2-person sub-pod (the 6-desk pod reorganized so you two work 
side-by-side), can see complete integration of your collaboration (shared project files 
with both your edits, whiteboard covered in both your handwriting, inside jokes on sticky 
notes, emergency snack drawer you stock together, "project wall" with your joint vision, 
photos from team events where you're always together, complementary work styles visible in 
organization - his structured, yours creative, working in harmony), 8 months of intensive 
partnership visible in every detail, your influence on each other obvious (you use his 
organization system now, he uses your brainstorming approach, hybrid collaboration style), 
space shows genuine friendship beyond work (personal photos, gifts exchanged, support 
through hard times), but current stakes threaten foundation - if he leaves, what happens 
to partnership? To project? To friendship?

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation. View from your desk chair 
(seated position), 4 feet from Alex (intimate working distance), eye level 4 feet height, 
angled to see his concealed decision materials. 16:9 aspect ratio. Rule of thirds composition 
with Alex at center-left (his struggle visible in posture), resignation letter on his 
monitor at upper center (visible to you, he doesn't know you can see), shared project wall 
at right third (8 months of collaboration). 3-layer depth: foreground (your shared workspace 
showing deep integration, your hands on keyboard continuing to work despite seeing his 
secret), mid-ground (Alex at his desk with decision materials, your joint project files, 
visible partnership), background (empty office, city night lights, rain on windows, isolation). 
Primary lighting: warm desk lamps (3000K) creating intimate pools of light, secondary: 
dimmed overhead LEDs (4000K) providing ambient, tertiary: city lights and monitor glow. 
Sharp atmospheric clarity - nothing hidden from your perspective (you see what he doesn't 
know you see), stakes are visible and immediate, moment demands truth you don't yet have.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Tense, bittersweet, weighted, intimate partnership under threat
- **Color Temperature**: Warm evening work (3000K desk / 4000K ambient)
- **Saturation**: Realistic (balanced, functional)
- **Shadow Density**: Medium (45% opacity, evening depth)
- **Detail Level**: Intimate partnership detail, secret visible
- **Emotional Resonance**: Stakes awareness, partnership value, impending loss
- **Narrative Hook**: Joint project + resignation draft + tomorrow deadline = ticking clock on partnership

## Example 4: Morning | Crisis Capacity | Contradiction Moment | Level 5 (Work Soulmate/Chosen Colleague)

### Context
- **Turn**: Morning (6 AM)
- **Season**: Winter
- **Player Capacity**: 1.5/10 (crisis mode, came to office as only anchor point)
- **Narrative Tension**: Contradiction Moment (Alex here at 6am when he said he'd resigned)
- **NPC Relationship**: Level 5 (work soulmate, 14 months, professional chosen family, can't imagine work without)

### Complete Prompt

```
A modern open-plan tech office occupying the 14th floor of a glass-facade building, featuring 
floor-to-ceiling windows with panoramic city views, exposed concrete ceiling with visible 
ductwork painted matte black, polished concrete floors, standing desk clusters (6 desks per 
pod with privacy screens), central collaboration zone with modular seating (bright yellow 
and teal accent colors), glass-walled conference rooms along perimeter, and abundant 
hanging plants. Distinctive features: feature wall with company logo (geometric mountain 
design in teal), espresso bar with industrial aesthetic, acoustic ceiling baffles in coral 
color. Base palette: cool gray concrete, matte black ceiling elements, teal and yellow 
accents, natural wood desk surfaces, white privacy screens.

Pre-dawn darkness with only security lighting active (weak 3000K emergency lights, minimal 
visibility), overhead LEDs not yet on automatic timer (office not officially open), city 
lights still dominant through windows but appearing cold and distant, blue-gray pre-dawn 
darkness outside, harsh minimal artificial lighting creating deep shadows throughout space, 
most of office in darkness, single desk lamp visible in distance (shouldn't be anyone here), 
oppressive early morning isolation, space designed for 100+ people now has 2, sense of 
wrongness - being here at this hour.

Deep winter pre-dawn: windows show dark city still mostly asleep, snow visible on distant 
rooftops, frost on external glass creating obscuring patterns, cold radiating from windows 
despite interior heating, winter darkness making 6am feel like middle of night, plants 
throughout space dormant or struggling, sense of life at minimum, season's harshness, 
isolation amplified by time and season, city below still sleeping while you're in crisis.

Severely desaturated palette (reduced 70% from baseline), scene appearing nearly monochrome 
except weak amber security lights, cold blue-gray tones dominating through windows (7500K), 
oppressive atmosphere with darkness consuming most space, minimal lighting creating harsh 
isolated pools rather than collaborative openness, emphasize profound isolation and 
disconnection, space designed for collaboration now emphasizes aloneness, foreboding heavy 
mood, colors barely registering through crisis lens, collaborative energy beauty completely 
absent - space feels alien and hostile despite familiarity, viewing through crisis dissociation.

CONTRADICTION MOMENT: You came to office in personal crisis because it's your anchor space 
(your life is chaos but work makes sense), used your badge expecting empty building. But 
Alex is here at his desk (visible in distance through darkness, single desk lamp illuminated), 
when you know he submitted resignation three days ago (last day should be next Friday). 
Contradiction creating intense confusion: Why is he here? Did he withdraw resignation? Did 
they fire him immediately? Is he collecting things? Pattern you know intimately (his schedule, 
his commitment to 2-week notice) is broken. His posture suggests he's working (not packing), 
coffee from espresso bar suggests he's settling in (not leaving quickly), his presence when 
you expected emptiness adds to your crisis rather than helping. You came here for stability 
and found more chaos. Visual dissonance: resigned person still at desk at 6am working 
intensely. Your footsteps approaching stop - do you reveal your crisis state? Does his 
presence help or complicate?

Deepest work relationship perspective from arrival in crisis: viewing from office entrance 
corridor (you just used badge, haven't entered main space yet), can barely see through 
darkness but Alex's station instantly recognizable (14 months of daily proximity), your 
workspace next to his visible as dark void where you should go, space shows complete 
professional integration (your desks essentially merged into joint workstation, shared 
everything, project walls covered in your combined 14-month history, can't tell where your 
work ends and his begins, professional chosen family visible in every detail, inside jokes 
everywhere, photos spanning over a year, complementary skills creating seamless partnership, 
you're better professionals together than apart), maximum investment - he's why you came 
to office for stability, but his unexpected presence while in contradiction with known 
resignation complicates everything. Space represents your strongest professional relationship 
and anchor point, now uncertain.

Painterly digital art style with photorealistic foundation, heavy atmospheric processing 
suggesting crisis perception. View from entry corridor (haven't entered main space, frozen 
at threshold), 40 feet from Alex's lit desk lamp (distant), standing eye level 5.5 feet 
height but perspective suggests unstable crisis stance. 16:9 aspect ratio. Rule of thirds 
composition with Alex's illuminated desk as single focal point at center (island of light 
in darkness), your dark empty desk visible at left third (where you should be but aren't 
yet), entry corridor threshold at bottom (you're stuck here). 3-layer depth: foreground 
(corridor where you're frozen, darkness, your shadow from security light), mid-ground (vast 
dark empty office space, most detail lost to darkness, sense of void), background (Alex's 
single lamp-lit desk, his presence contradicting known reality, only concrete visible detail). 
Lighting: weak security lights (3000K) providing minimal navigation light, single distant 
desk lamp at Alex's station (impossible to miss, drawing eye), pre-dawn blue-black outside 
windows (7500K), harsh contrast between tiny islands of light and overwhelming darkness. 
Heavy atmospheric processing: extreme darkness consuming most frame, tunnel vision to lit 
desk area, peripheral vision nearly black, crisis perception creating both distance and 
hyper-focus on contradiction, dissociation making familiar space feel alien.
```

### Visual Characteristics
- **Mood**: Crisis layered on contradiction, isolation compounded, anchor point destabilized
- **Color Temperature**: Extreme split (3000K weak / 7500K pre-dawn)
- **Saturation**: Severely reduced 70% (monochrome except lamp)
- **Shadow Density**: Overwhelming (90% opacity, darkness dominant)
- **Detail Level**: Tunnel vision - single lit area visible, rest darkness
- **Emotional Resonance**: Crisis seeking anchor finding more uncertainty
- **Narrative Hook**: Work soulmate present after resignation + 6am presence + pattern violation = reality questioned
