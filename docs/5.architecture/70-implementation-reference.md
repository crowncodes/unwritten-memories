**Contains:**
- Architecture patterns and rationale
- Technology choices
- Design principles
- High-level guides
- Cross-cutting concerns

**Audience:** Architects, senior developers, decision makers

### Implementation Docs (app/docs/)

**Purpose:** Practical implementation reference

**Contains:**
- Package usage examples with code
- Setup and configuration steps
- Implementation-specific details
- Build and deployment procedures
- Troubleshooting guides

**Audience:** Developers actively building features

## When to Use Which

### Use Architecture Docs When:

- Planning new features
- Making technology decisions
- Understanding overall system design
- Learning about I/O FLIP patterns
- Reviewing architectural trade-offs

### Use Implementation Docs When:

- Setting up development environment
- Looking up package usage
- Implementing specific features
- Debugging build issues
- Learning API usage

---

## Documentation Maintenance

### Architecture Docs

**Update Frequency:** When architecture changes  
**Triggers:**
- Major design decisions
- New technology adoption
- Pattern changes
- Performance requirement updates

### Implementation Docs

**Update Frequency:** When implementation changes  
**Triggers:**
- Package version updates
- API changes
- New feature implementations
- Build process changes
