## STYLE 1: Pixar-Inspired 3D

### Overview
**Aesthetic:** Warm, stylized 3D character rendering with emotional lighting

### Key Features
- Soft subsurface scattering on skin
- Warm rim lighting (golden hour effect)
- Slightly exaggerated proportions (big eyes, expressive)
- Ambient occlusion for depth
- Studio-quality character lighting

### Sarah Anderson Example
```
Sarah is lit like a Pixar short film character. Golden beam streams through the cafÃ© 
window, creating a warm rim light along her profile. Her features are slightly stylizedâ€”
eyes a bit larger and more expressive, giving her that appealing Pixar character quality.

Subsurface scattering makes her skin glow softly where light passes through her ears. 
Her blue scarf has realistic fabric folds but simplified, appealing shapes. The bookshop 
behind her has that perfect Pixar environmental storytellingâ€”warm wood tones, soft focus 
background, carefully placed props that hint at story.

Everything feels three-dimensional but stylized, warm, emotionally inviting. You want 
to know her story. Classic Pixar emotional resonance.
```

## STYLE 2: Noir Graphic Novel

### Overview
**Aesthetic:** High-contrast black & white with dramatic film noir lighting

### Key Features
- Pure black and white (no grays, only patterns)
- Dramatic shadows and highlights
- Rain effects and venetian blind shadows optional
- Bold ink-like lines
- Film noir cinematography

### Sarah Anderson Example
```
Sarah emerges from shadow in stark black and white. Half her face is pure white highlight, 
the other half lost in solid black shadow. Her blue scarf (now grayscale) has bold white 
highlights where light catches fabric folds.

Rain streaks down the cafÃ© window behind her (noir clichÃ©, but perfect). Venetian blind 
shadows cut across the scene. Her coffee cup casts a dramatic shadow. Everything is 
high-contrast dramaâ€”no mid-tones, just pure blacks and bright whites.

Mood: mysterious, dramatic, film noir atmosphere. Sarah looks like she's about to reveal 
a crucial plot point in a detective story.

## STYLE 3: Cyberpunk Neon Glow

### Overview
**Aesthetic:** Dark backgrounds with glowing neon accents, futuristic dystopia

### Key Features
- Dark, moody base colors
- Bright neon glows (magenta, cyan, yellow)
- Holographic effects optional
- Rain and reflections
- Blade Runner / Cyberpunk 2077 influence

### Sarah Anderson Example
```
Sarah's bookshop transforms into "The Reading Room"â€”neon kanji glows electric pink in the 
window. Dark, moody atmosphere with rain falling outside. Her face is lit by cyan 
underglow from the coffee cup (holographic menu interface floating above it).

Magenta and cyan rim lights outline her figure against the dark background. Her glasses 
reflect neon signs. Books on shelves have glowing spine labels. Steam from coffee has 
electric blue bioluminescent quality.

Everything glows. Dark, futuristic, atmosphericâ€”Sarah as cyberpunk bookshop keeper in 
neon-soaked future Portland.
```

## STYLE 4: Cel-Shaded 3D Comic

### Overview
**Aesthetic:** 3D models with thick ink outlines and flat cel-shading

### Key Features
- 3D models with black outline rendering

- Bold comic book inking effect
- Borderlands / Jet Set Radio influence
- Dynamic, graphic quality

### Sarah Anderson Example
```
Sarah is a 3D model with thick black outlines rendering every edge. Her face has flat 
cel-shadingâ€”one tone for light, one for mid-tone, one for shadow. No smooth gradients, 
just graphic color blocks defining form.

Bold black lines trace her features, hair, clothing. The effect is like a living comic 
bookâ€”3D but graphic, dimensional but stylized. She moves and the outlines move with her, 
creating that signature cel-shaded look.

Borderlands meets graphic novel. Dynamic, bold, perfect for action-oriented moments.
