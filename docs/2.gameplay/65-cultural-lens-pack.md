## STYLE 1: Japanese Sumi-e

**Aesthetic:** Black ink wash, minimalist, Zen brush painting

**Sarah Example:**
```
Sarah rendered in flowing black ink on off-white paper. Minimal brush strokes suggest 
her features‚Äîa few confident lines for her face, hair flowing in elegant calligraphic 
strokes. Her scarf is a single wash of ink, darker where wet, lighter where dry.

Cherry blossom petals (subtle) float in negative space. The bookshop is suggested by 
three brush strokes. Extreme minimalism, meditative, beautiful empty space. Zen calm.
