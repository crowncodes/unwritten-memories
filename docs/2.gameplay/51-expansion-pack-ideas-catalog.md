## Design Principles for All Expansion Packs

### 1. Master Template Multiplication
Each pack's templates interact with ALL existing content:
- New character archetypes can have relationships with any NPC
- New activities can evolve into cherished memories
- New locations can become emotional anchors
- **Value is exponential, not additive**

### 2. Anti-Gamification Compliance
All packs must:
- Use `ENGINE_WRITERS_ROOM` qualitative assessment for progression
- NO arbitrary numerical thresholds ("do X 16 times")
- Contextual evolution based on personality, capacity, timing
- Journey Beats required for relationship progression

### 3. Emotional Authenticity
Every pack must:
- Respect `ENGINE_CAPACITY` mechanics
- Display capacity warnings for high-intensity content
- Model realistic timelines (medical school takes YEARS)
- Include failure states that create narrative (not game overs)

### 4. Cultural Sensitivity
For culture/identity packs:
- Consult with community members during design
- Avoid stereotypes and exoticization
- Include content warnings where appropriate
- Represent diversity within cultures (not monoliths)

### 5. Accessibility Considerations
Design for varied player needs:
- Offer low-intensity alternatives for every life domain
- Include restorative content for capacity recovery
- Provide content warnings for trauma/difficult themes
- Allow opt-out of specific content types
