## STYLE 1: Dream Sequence (Pastel Bloom)

**Aesthetic:** Soft glows, pastel halos, gentle blur, ethereal quality

**Sarah Example:**
```
Sarah surrounded by soft pastel glowâ€”edges of her figure blur into light. Gentle bloom 
effect makes everything slightly hazy, dreamy. Colors are soft pastelsâ€”her scarf glows 
soft blue, cafÃ© window has golden halo. Dust motes float, backlit. Feels like memory 
of a dream. Perfect for CONTENT, PEACEFUL, HOPEFUL states.

**Dynamic:** Glow intensifies when player feels JOYFUL or PEACEFUL.
```

## STYLE 2: Melancholy Desaturated

**Aesthetic:** Muted colors, rain, cool tones, introspective atmosphere

**Sarah Example:**
```
Colors drain to muted, desaturated tones. Sarah's blue scarf becomes gray-blue. Rain 
streaks down cafÃ© window. Everything feels subdued, quiet, introspective. Cool color 
paletteâ€”blues and grays dominate. Perfect for MELANCHOLY, LONELY, REFLECTIVE states.

**Dynamic:** Desaturation increases when player feels SAD or LONELY. Rain intensifies.
```

## STYLE 3: Memory / Sepia

**Aesthetic:** Warm sepia tones, faded edges, vintage photograph quality

**Sarah Example:**
```
Sarah appears in warm sepiaâ€”golden browns and cream tones. Edges fade into white like 
old photographs. Slight grain overlay. Feels like looking at cherished memory from 
years ago. Nostalgic, bittersweet, precious. Perfect for NOSTALGIC, REFLECTIVE states.

**Dynamic:** Sepia warmth increases, edges fade more when NOSTALGIC emotion active.
```

## STYLE 4: Nightmare / Expressionist Distortion

**Aesthetic:** Warped perspectives, harsh angular shadows, anxiety visualization

**Sarah Example:**
```
When Sarah faces hard choices, reality warps. Perspectives skew at uncomfortable anglesâ€”
cafÃ© tilts, books lean ominously. Harsh angular shadows cut across scene. Colors become 
harsh, contrasting. Her face shows subtle distortionâ€”eyes slightly too far apart, 
proportions unsettling. Visual representation of internal anxiety.

**Dynamic:** Distortion intensifies during ANXIOUS, STRESSED, OVERWHELMED states.
