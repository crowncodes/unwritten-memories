## STYLE 1: Stardew-Like Cozy Pixel

**Aesthetic:** Warm, detailed pixel art with cozy farming game vibes

**Sarah Example:**
```
Sarah as cozy pixel sprite (32x32 or 64x64). Warm pixel colorsâ€”peachy skin, brown hair 
with highlight pixels. Her bookshop is pixel-perfect isometricâ€”tiny book sprites, 
wooden shelves, glowing window pixels. Soft, warm, inviting. Stardew Valley energyâ€”
you want to befriend her and bring her coffee.
```

## STYLE 2: Sketchbook / Concept Art

**Aesthetic:** Rough pencil sketches, visible construction lines, creative process

**Sarah Example:**
```
Sarah drawn in rough pencil with visible construction lines still showing. Some areas 
finished, others just sketched outlines. Color swatches in corner. Artist notes: "blue 
scarf - cerulean?" Feels like behind-the-scenes concept art. Raw, creative, unpolished 
but beautiful. You're seeing her being "drawn into existence."
```

## STYLE 3: Low-Poly Stylized 3D

**Aesthetic:** Simple geometric 3D models, flat-shaded, Monument Valley style

**Sarah Example:**
```
Sarah as low-poly 3D modelâ€”face made of ~500 polygons. Flat shading (no smooth gradients), 
geometric beauty. Her scarf is 20 triangles. Books are simple rectangular prisms. 
Clean, modern, stylized. Monument Valley / Journey aestheticâ€”simple but elegant.
```

## STYLE 4: Flat-Color Minimalist

**Aesthetic:** Pure flat shapes, no outlines, modern graphic design

**Sarah Example:**
```
Sarah as pure flat shapesâ€”face is peach circle, hair is brown organic blob, eyes are 
two dots. No outlines, just overlapping colored shapes. Ultra-minimal but somehow still 
recognizable. Modern design, Kurzgesagt style. Clean, bold, contemporary.
```
