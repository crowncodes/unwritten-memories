# Decisive Decision Templates - Implementation Specification

**Compliance:** master_truths_canonical_spec_v_1_2.md (v1.2)  
**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025  
**Purpose:** Complete scaffolding and templates for authoring decisive decisions with emotional authenticity

**References:**
- **Design Philosophy:** `1.concept/15-progression-phases.md` (WHY decisive moments matter)
- **Narrative Structure:** `31-narrative-arc-scaffolding.md` (3-act season structure)
- **Season Flow:** `73-season-flow-implementation.md` (when decisions appear)

---

## Overview

**Decisive Decisions** are life-altering choices that pause time, create genuine tension, and have cascading consequences across weeks or seasons. They are the narrative backbone of Unwritten.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Time pauses** - No FOMO, no real-time pressure
2. **Clear stakes** - Player understands what's at risk
3. **No perfect answer** - Every option has tradeoffs
4. **Long-term consequences** - Choices echo for weeks/seasons
5. **Foreshadowed** - Never appear randomly from nowhere

**Multi-Season Context:** Decisive decisions can have consequences that last beyond the current season. Since characters persist across **8-10 seasons** (Life Bookshelf), major decisions in Season 2 might still affect Season 5. The memory and regret systems track choices across the character's entire life. See `73-season-flow-implementation.md` for multi-season continuity.

**Compliance:** master_truths v1.2 requires "Decisive decisions pause time; copy avoids FOMO framing; options respect emotional capacity and personality constraints"

## Master Truths v1.2: Emotional Authenticity Features *(NEW)*

### Gap 3.2: Emotional Capacity Gating

Decisions respect emotional capacity - some options are locked when capacity is too low:

```javascript
const CAPACITY_GATED_DECISION = {
  id: "support_friend_crisis_while_struggling",
  title: "WHEN YOU'RE BARELY HOLDING ON",
  
  decision_card: {
    narrative: `
      Sarah calls. She's crying. "I need you. Can you come over?"
      
      Your capacity: 2.8/10
      
      You're barely holding it together yourself. Work is crushing you. 
      Your physical meter is at 3. You haven't slept properly in days. 
      Your own problems feel overwhelming.
      
      Sarah needs you. But what do you have left to give?
    `,
    
    options: [
      {
        id: "be_there_fully",
        label: "\"I'll be right there\" (Full support)",
        
        // LOCKED - Capacity too low
        emotional_capacity_requirements: {
          min_capacity: 5.0,
          capacity_consumed: 2.5,
          locked_if_below: 4.0,
          locked_reason: "You don't have the emotional capacity for this right now",
          alternative_if_locked: "Consider limited support or asking for help"
        },
        
        // This option is GRAYED OUT with explanation
        locked: true,
        locked_display: `
          ‚ùå [UNAVAILABLE - Emotional Capacity Too Low]
          
          Your capacity: 2.8/10
          Required: 4.0+
          
          You can't give what you don't have. Supporting Sarah fully would 
          require emotional resources you simply don't have right now. You'd 
          end up making things worse for both of you.
          
          See other options below.

          emotional: -2

          You go to Sarah. You're honest: "I'm struggling too right now."
          
          She sees it in your face. You sit together. Two people barely 
          holding on, holding each other up.
          
          It's not the strong support she needed, but it's honest. And 
          sometimes that matters more.

It's Saturday evening. The restaurant is beautiful‚Äîcandlelight, your favorite wine, Alex's nervous smile.

You've been together 18 months. Living together for 6. You know their morning coffee order, their anxiety tells, the way they hum when they're happy.

The waiter clears dessert. Alex reaches across the table, takes your hand.

"I need to ask you something."

They get down on one knee. Several tables around you notice. Your heart is pounding.

"I love you. I want to build a life with you. Will you marry me?"

The ring is beautiful. Everyone is watching. 

But your mind is racing:
- Your career just took off. Marriage means stability but also... expectations.
- Alex wants kids someday. You're not sure you do.
- Your families have different values. Different expectations.
- Is 18 months enough? Is any amount of time ever enough?
- You love them. But is that enough?

Alex is waiting. The restaurant is silent.

**Time is paused. This is one of the most important decisions of your life. Take all the time you need.**

## Decision Authoring Guidelines (Updated for v1.2)

### Master Truths v1.2 Requirements

**All decisive decisions MUST include:**
1. ‚úÖ **Emotional capacity requirements** - Specify min_capacity per option
2. ‚úÖ **Personality modifiers** - Define how OCEAN traits affect options
3. ‚úÖ **Circumstance awareness** - Consider stressor stacking effects
4. ‚úÖ **NPC awareness** - NPCs notice when player is struggling
5. ‚úÖ **Locked option explanations** - Tell players WHY options are unavailable
6. ‚úÖ **Memory resonance** - Reference past similar decisions when relevant

### 1. Foreshadowing (Always)

**Rule:** Never drop major decisions from nowhere. Foreshadow 2-4 weeks ahead.

```javascript
// BAD: No warning
week_12: MARRIAGE_PROPOSAL (surprise!)

// GOOD: Foreshadowed
week_8: "Alex asks about future plans"
week_10: "Alex seems nervous, shopping for something"
week_11: "Alex reserves nice restaurant"
week_12: MARRIAGE_PROPOSAL
```

### 2. Real Tradeoffs (Always)

**Rule:** No option should be obviously correct. All have costs.

```javascript
// BAD: One option is clearly better
option_a: +5 all meters, +$5000, +3 relationships, no downsides
option_b: -3 all meters, -$1000, lose friends

// GOOD: Genuine dilemmas
option_a: Follow dream (+emotional, +passion) but risk finances and relationships
option_b: Play it safe (+money, +stability) but lose dream and carry regret
```

### 3. Long-Term Consequences (Always)

**Rule:** Decisions must echo for weeks or seasons, not just one turn.

```javascript
// BAD: Over immediately
immediate_effects: { emotional: +2 }
// Done! No lasting impact.

// GOOD: Ripple effects
immediate: { emotional: +2 }
week_1: "First consequence unfolds"
week_4: "Secondary effect emerges"
week_12: "Long-term arc change"
week_24: "Callback/reference"
```

### 4. Time Paused (Always)

**Rule:** master_truths v1.1 compliance - decisions must pause time, no real-time pressure.

```javascript
// BAD: Real-time pressure
"You have 60 real seconds to decide!"
"Timer counting down..."

// GOOD: In-world deadline, paused time
"Must decide before Friday" (in-game time)
"Take as long as you need to decide."
display_message: "‚è∏Ô∏è Time is paused while you decide"
```

### 5. Context Display (Always)

**Rule:** Give players all info needed to make informed choice.

```javascript
display_context: {
  show_meters: true,
  show_money: true,
  show_relationships: ["all", "relevant", "npcs"],
  show_arc_progress: ["affected_arcs"],
  review_options: [
    "View relationship history",
    "Review financial status",
    "Check personality compatibility",
    "See long-term goals"
  ]
}
```

---

## Master Truths v1.2 Authoring Guidelines *(NEW)*

### 6. Emotional Capacity Gating (NEW - v1.2)

**Rule:** Consider player's emotional state - some options require capacity.

```javascript
// GOOD: Capacity-aware options
options: [
  {
    id: "heroic_support",
    label: "Be there fully for them",
    emotional_capacity_requirements: {
      min_capacity: 5.0,
      locked_if_below: 4.0,
      locked_reason: "You don't have the emotional resources for this right now",
      alternative_if_locked: "Consider limited support or asking for help"
    }
  },
  {
    id: "limited_support",
    label: "Help, but acknowledge your limits",
    emotional_capacity_requirements: {
      min_capacity: 2.0  // Available even when struggling
    }
  }
]

// BAD: Ignoring capacity constraints
options: [
  { id: "save_everyone", label: "Fix everything!" }
  // No acknowledgment that player might be at capacity 1.5 and can't do this
]
```

### 7. Personality Integration (NEW - v1.2)

**Rule:** Options should feel different based on OCEAN traits.

```javascript
// GOOD: Personality-aware
{
  id: "confront_publicly",
  personality_modifiers: {
    recommended_for: {
      extraversion: { min: 3.5 },      // Easier for extraverts
      neuroticism: { max: 3.0 }        // Harder if anxious
    },
    difficulty_by_trait: {
      low_extraversion: "Success -20% if < 2.5",
      high_neuroticism: "Success -15% if > 4.0"
    },
    personality_consequence: {
      if_low_extraversion: "Huge growth moment - acted against nature",
      if_high_neuroticism: "Anxiety spikes, but you did it"
    }
  }
}

// BAD: One-size-fits-all
{
  id: "confront",
  // Same for everyone regardless of personality
}
```

### 8. Circumstance Stacking (NEW - v1.2)

**Rule:** Multiple stressors compound and affect decision quality.

```javascript
// GOOD: Stressor-aware
{
  id: "take_on_more",
  circumstance_effects: {
    affected_by_stressors: true,
    stressor_penalty: -0.10,         // -10% per active stressor
    overwhelmed_locked: true         // Locked if OVERWHELMED state
  },
  
  locked_display: (player) => {
    if (player.stressor_count >= 4) {
      return `
        ‚ö†Ô∏è You have ${player.stressor_count} active stressors.
        Taking this on has a ${player.stressor_count * 10}% penalty.
        Success rate: ${calculateRate()}%
        
        This is likely to fail. Consider other options.
      `;
    }
  }
}

// BAD: Ignoring context
{
  id: "take_on_more",
  // Player can "hero through" anything regardless of state
}
```

### 9. NPC Awareness (NEW - v1.2)

**Rule:** NPCs should notice when player is struggling.

```javascript
// GOOD: NPCs react to player state
npc_awareness: {
  marcus_perception: "Marcus notices you look exhausted",
  marcus_response: `
    Marcus: "Hey... you okay? You don't look great."
    
    [His Agreeableness: 4.2 - perceptive and caring]
    
    He's giving you an out. He can tell you're not okay.
  `,
  
  alternate_if_high_capacity: `
    Marcus: "Perfect timing! You seem energized."
  `
}

// BAD: NPCs oblivious to player state
marcus_dialogue: "Hey, you look great!"
// (Even though player is at capacity 1.2, exhausted, OVERWHELMED)
```

### 10. Locked Option Communication (NEW - v1.2)

**Rule:** Always explain WHY an option is unavailable.

```javascript
// GOOD: Clear explanation
locked_display: `
  ‚ùå [UNAVAILABLE - Emotional Capacity Too Low]
  
  Your capacity: 2.3/10
  Required: 4.0+
  
  You can't give what you don't have. This option requires emotional 
  resources you don't currently have. You'd make things worse.
  
  Alternative: Try "Limited Support" or "Ask for Help" below.
`

// BAD: Vague or no explanation
locked: true
// Option just grayed out, no explanation why
```

---

## Multi-Season Decision Consequences

**Decisions can echo across multiple seasons.** Since characters live through **8-10 seasons**, a major decision in Season 2 can still be referenced in Season 7.

### Example: Multi-Season Consequences

```javascript
const MULTI_SEASON_DECISION = {
  season: 2,
  decision: "Chose work over wedding shoot (abandoned photography dream)",
  
  immediate_consequences: [
    { season: 2, week: 0, effect: "Promotion track intact" },
    { season: 2, week: 4, effect: "Photography friend drifts away" }
  ],
  
  carries_to_season_3: {
    regret_level: "moderate",
    photography_skill: "atrophied (-2)",
    career_path: "corporate_locked_in",
    reference_events: [
      "Seeing wedding photos online triggers regret",
      "Old camera equipment sits unused"
    ]
  },
  
  carries_to_season_5: {
    regret_level: "high",
    age: 33,
    life_state: "Mid-30s corporate burnout",
    possible_arc: "Second chance at dream?",
    reference_events: [
      "Finding old camera triggers Season 2 flashback",
      "Meeting photographer friend again (if maintained relationship)",
      "Decisive decision: Quit corporate life?"
    ]
  },
  
  carries_to_season_8: {
    age: 38,
    possible_resolution: "Either fully accepted choice or finally pursuing dream",
    novel_chapter: "This decision becomes a major chapter in Life Bookshelf"
  }
};
```

**Design Guidelines:**
- **Legendary decisions** (marriage, career changes, major life choices) ‚Üí Echo 3-6 seasons
- **Major decisions** (relationship conflicts, career steps) ‚Üí Echo 1-3 seasons  
- **Memory system** tracks all decisions across character's life
- **Regret system** can trigger callbacks years later
- **Time skips** reference major decisions in auto-generated narrative

**Complete details:** See `73-season-flow-implementation.md` for memory tracking across seasons and how decisions affect time skip narratives.

      Marcus has been planning this gallery show for 8 months. It's his dream. 
      His first solo show. He specifically asked you to be there.
      
      The client presentation could make your career. Your boss said "mandatory." 
      Missing it could cost you the promotion you've been working toward.
