## STYLE 1: Studio Ghibli-Inspired

**Aesthetic:** Warm hand-drawn animation with magical realism touches

**Sarah Example:**
```
Sarah's bookshop becomes a Ghibli-style café surrounded by floating dust motes that glow 
like fireflies. Her blue scarf flutters as if it has life of its own. Books on shelves 
have gentle magical aura—some float slightly. Warm, hand-drawn linework with watercolor 
backgrounds.

The window shows a sky of impossible beauty—clouds painted in soft pastels. A small 
spirit creature (kodama-like) sits on her shoulder. Everything has that Ghibli warmth—
magical but grounded, fantastical but emotionally real. Spirited Away meets My Neighbor 
Totoro energy.
```

## STYLE 2: Fantasy Illustration (Storybook)

**Aesthetic:** Detailed painted fantasy art, classic fantasy book covers

**Sarah Example:**
```
Sarah rendered as fantasy protagonist—her bookshop becomes an ancient library with 
glowing runes on book spines. She wears flowing robes (her cardigan transformed). 
Magic sparkles around her hands as she holds a glowing tome instead of coffee.

Detailed oil painting style, classic fantasy illustration. Dragons carved into wooden 
shelves. Mystical atmosphere—candles float, pages turn themselves. High fantasy 
D&D aesthetic. She looks like she's on the cover of a fantasy novel.
```

## STYLE 3: Celestial / Cosmic Glow

**Aesthetic:** Stars, nebulas, cosmic energy, space-themed ethereal beauty

**Sarah Example:**
```
Sarah's silhouette filled with swirling galaxies and nebulas. Her hair flows like cosmic 
dust, stars twinkling within. The café dissolves into cosmic space—planets float where 
coffee cups should be. Her eyes reflect entire galaxies.

Deep space colors: purples, deep blues, bright star whites. Cosmic energy swirls around 
her. Books become constellations. Everything glows with ethereal space energy. 
Universe-scale beauty condensed into intimate café moment.
```

## STYLE 4: Gothic Fairy-Tale

**Aesthetic:** Dark forests, Victorian gothic, Brothers Grimm atmosphere

**Sarah Example:**
```
Sarah's café becomes a Victorian Gothic parlor in a dark enchanted forest. Twisted tree 
branches frame the scene. Her blue scarf becomes deep midnight blue velvet. Candlelight 
(no electric lights), long shadows, mysterious atmosphere.

Books are ancient grimoires with brass clasps. Ravens perch on shelves. Fog curls at 
floor level. Color palette: deep blacks, midnight blues, blood reds, bone whites. 
Beautiful but eerie. Tim Burton meets Brothers Grimm. Dark fairy-tale energy—
not horror, but Gothic romance.
```
