      Sarah's bookshop glows in soft strokes and layered textures. Her blue scarf 
      diffuses into flowing brush marks, edges bleeding into the warm café background. 
      Her freckles are rendered like sun-kissed pigments on paper. The coffee cup 
      she holds has gentle color blooms where the liquid meets porcelain. Light 
      streams through the window in pale golden washes.
    `,
    emotional_note: "Perfect for MELANCHOLY, REFLECTIVE, and CONTENT states"
  }

  sarah_anderson_example: {
    description: "Sarah in dramatic café lighting",
    transformation: `
      Sarah emerges from shadow in rich, layered paint. Thick brushstrokes define 
      her jawline and the curve of her scarf. The bookshop behind her is rendered 
      in warm browns and deep shadows—each book spine a careful stroke. Light 
      from the window creates Rembrandt-like chiaroscuro, her face luminous against 
      dark wooden shelves. Paint texture is visible on every surface, giving depth 
      and presence.
    `,
    emotional_note: "Amplifies CONFIDENT, DETERMINED, and TRIUMPHANT states"

  sarah_anderson_example: {
    description: "Sarah as mid-century poster",
    transformation: `
      Sarah rendered in bold, flat shapes—her blue scarf a solid geometric form 
      against her cream cardigan. The café becomes a graphic composition of overlapping 
      rectangles and circles. Her face is simplified but expressive, eyes two dark 
      shapes with a glint of highlight. Text could almost appear saying "CAFÉ LUNA" 
      in vintage typography. Colors are vibrant but matte, like a 1960s travel poster.
    `,
    emotional_note: "Perfect for EXCITED, HOPEFUL, and JOYFUL states"

  },
  
  sarah_anderson_example: {
    description: "Sarah in dappled café light",
    transformation: `
      Sarah dissolves into dabs of color—her face a composition of peach, cream, 
      and rose tones that somehow coalesce into features. The café window behind 
      her breaks into shimmering fragments of light. Her blue scarf is rendered 
      in pure color patches—cobalt, cerulean, and violet dancing together. Everything 
      has a luminous, almost vibrating quality, as if light itself is the subject. 
      You can see individual brush dabs up close, but step back and she's perfectly there.
    `,
    emotional_note: "Enhances PEACEFUL, NOSTALGIC, and CONTENT states"
  }
