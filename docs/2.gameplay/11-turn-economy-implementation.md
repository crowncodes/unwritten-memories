## Overview

Unwritten uses a **multi-resource economy** where players manage 6 different resource types simultaneously. This creates meaningful choices and prevents trivial gameplay loops.

**Core Principle:** Every card costs MULTIPLE resources. Players must balance Energy, Time, Money, Social Capital, Comfort Zone, and Success Probability.

---

## The 6 Resource Types

### 1. ‚ö° Energy (Daily Pool - Regenerating)

**Purpose:** Limits actions per time period, creates natural pacing

**Budget:**
```javascript
const ENERGY_BUDGET = {
  // WEEKDAY (Monday-Friday)
  weekday: {
    morning:   3,  // 6am-12pm
    afternoon: 3,  // 12pm-6pm
    evening:   2,  // 6pm-12am
    daily_total: 8
  },
  
  // WEEKEND (Saturday-Sunday)
  weekend: {
    morning:   4,  // Rested!
    afternoon: 4,
    evening:   3,
    daily_total: 11
  }
};
```

**Regeneration:**
- Energy regenerates **at the start of each phase**
- Does NOT carry over between phases
- Morning starts with full Morning energy (3 or 4)
- Cannot "save" energy for later

**Energy Costs by Activity:**
```javascript
const ENERGY_COSTS = {
  light:   1,  // Reading, social media, casual chat
  medium:  2,  // Workout, social event, hobby practice
  heavy:   3,  // Intense activity, multiple people, high focus
  epic:    4   // Only possible on weekends (morning/afternoon)
};
```

**Modified by Meters:**
```javascript
function getMaxEnergy(phase, dayType, physicalMeter) {
  let baseEnergy = ENERGY_BUDGET[dayType][phase];
  
  // Low physical meter reduces max energy
  if (physicalMeter <= 2) {
    baseEnergy -= 1; // Exhausted
  } else if (physicalMeter <= 4) {
    baseEnergy -= 0; // Normal
  } else if (physicalMeter >= 8) {
    baseEnergy += 1; // Energized!
  }
  
  return Math.max(1, baseEnergy); // Minimum 1
}
```

---

### 2. ‚è∞ Time (Weekly Budget - Scarce)

**Purpose:** Forces prioritization, creates opportunity cost

**Weekly Time Model:**
```javascript
const TIME_BUDGET = {
  total_hours: 168,  // 7 days √ó 24 hours
  
  fixed_obligations: {
    sleep:         56,  // 8 hours/night √ó 7 days
    work:          45,  // 9 hours/day √ó 5 days (includes commute)
    basic_needs:   14,  // Eating, hygiene, errands
    total_fixed:  115
  },
  
  flexible_hours: 53,  // What player actually controls
  
  // But weekday vs. weekend matters:
  weekday_flexible: 21,  // ~3 hours/day √ó 7 days (after work)
  weekend_flexible: 32   // ~16 hours/day √ó 2 days
};
```

**Activity Time Costs:**
```javascript
const TIME_COSTS = {
  quick:    0.5,  // 30 minutes (text conversation, quick errand)
  short:    1.0,  // 1 hour (coffee date, gym session)
  medium:   2.0,  // 2 hours (dinner, movie, hobby project)
  long:     3.0,  // 3 hours (day trip, deep work, party)
  extended: 6.0,  // 6+ hours (all-day event, major project)
  weekend:  12.0  // Full weekend day commitment
};
```

**Time Tracking:**
```javascript
class TimeTracker {
  constructor() {
    this.weeklyBudget = 53; // Flexible hours
    this.spent = 0;
    this.remaining = 53;
  }
  
  spendTime(hours, activity) {
    if (this.remaining < hours) {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: "Not enough time this week",
        suggestion: "This would put you over budget. Skip something else or wait until next week."
      };
    }
    
    this.spent += hours;
    this.remaining -= hours;
    
    return { success: true, remaining: this.remaining };
  }
  
  resetWeekly() {
    this.spent = 0;
    this.remaining = 53;
  }
}
```

**Time Scarcity Effects:**
```javascript
function getTimeWarnings(timeRemaining) {
  if (timeRemaining < 5) {
    return {
      level: "critical",
      message: "You have less than 5 hours left this week. Weekend is packed!",
      effect: "stress_meter += 1"
    };
  } else if (timeRemaining < 15) {
    return {
      level: "warning",
      message: "You're running low on free time. Be selective.",
      effect: "optional_activities_filtered"
    };
  }
  return { level: "ok" };
}
```

### 3. üí∞ Money (Monthly Budget - Liquid)

**Purpose:** Creates financial pressure, enables life simulation depth

**Income Sources:**
```javascript
const INCOME_BY_CAREER = {
  entry_level:        2500,  // Barista, retail, entry jobs
  mid_career:         4500,  // Designer, programmer, teacher
  established:        7000,  // Senior roles, small business owner
  high_earning:      12000   // Executive, successful entrepreneur
};
```

**Fixed Monthly Expenses:**
```javascript
const MONTHLY_EXPENSES = {
  rent:              1200,  // Apartment (varies by city/phase)
  utilities:          150,  // Electric, internet, phone
  groceries:          400,  // Food for month
  transportation:     200,  // Car/transit
  insurance:          150,  // Health, car
  total_fixed:       2100
};

// Auto-deducted weekly:
const WEEKLY_EXPENSES = MONTHLY_EXPENSES.total_fixed / 4;  // ~$525/week
```

**Discretionary Spending:**
```javascript
function getDiscretionaryIncome(monthlyIncome) {
  return monthlyIncome - MONTHLY_EXPENSES.total_fixed;
}

// Examples:
// Entry level ($2,500): $400 discretionary
// Mid career ($4,500): $2,400 discretionary
// Established ($7,000): $4,900 discretionary
```

**Activity Money Costs:**
```javascript
const MONEY_COSTS = {
  free:          0,    // Most activities
  budget:       15,    // Coffee, casual meal, movie
  moderate:     50,    // Nice dinner, concert, class
  expensive:   150,    // Weekend trip, fancy event
  major:       500,    // Electronics, furniture, course
  investment: 5000     // Car, business investment, moving
};
```

**Financial Crisis System:**
```javascript
function checkFinancialStatus(currentMoney, weekOfMonth) {
  // Week 4 = bills due soon
  if (weekOfMonth === 4 && currentMoney < WEEKLY_EXPENSES) {
    return {
      crisis: true,
      type: "cant_pay_rent",
      consequences: ["stress_increase", "crisis_event_card", "career_pressure"]
    };
  }
  
  // General low money
  if (currentMoney < 200) {
    return {
      warning: true,
      message: "You're running low on money",
      effects: ["expensive_activities_hidden", "stress_increase"]
    };
  }
  
  return { status: "ok" };
}
```

---

### 4. ü§ù Social Capital (Relationship Currency)

**Purpose:** Prevents exploiting relationships, adds social realism

**How It Works:**
- Each relationship has a **Social Capital balance** (starts at 0)
- Doing things FOR someone: +Social Capital
- Asking things FROM someone: -Social Capital
- Negative balance = relationship strain

**Social Capital Mechanics:**
```javascript
class RelationshipSocialCapital {
  constructor(npcId) {
    this.npcId = npcId;
    this.balance = 0;
    this.min = -5;
    this.max = 10;
  }
  
  // When YOU do something for THEM
  earn(amount, action) {
    this.balance = Math.min(this.max, this.balance + amount);
    return {
      newBalance: this.balance,
      message: `${action} - they appreciate this.`
    };
  }
  
  // When you ASK something from THEM
  spend(amount, favor) {
    if (this.balance < amount) {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: "Not enough social capital",
        suggestion: "You've asked for a lot recently. Maybe help them first?"
      };
    }
    
    this.balance -= amount;
    
    if (this.balance < 0) {
      return {
        success: true,
        newBalance: this.balance,
        warning: "They'll do it, but you're going into social debt."
      };
    }
    
    return { success: true, newBalance: this.balance };
  }
}
```

**Social Capital Costs:**
```javascript
const SOCIAL_CAPITAL_COSTS = {
  small_favor:    1,   // "Can you help me move one box?"
  medium_favor:   2,   // "Can you help me move apartments?"
  big_favor:      3,   // "Can I borrow $500?"
  huge_favor:     5,   // "Can I stay with you for a month?"
  
  // Earning back:
  help_them:     +1,   // You help with their problem
  be_there:      +2,   // Support in crisis
  thoughtful:    +1,   // Remember birthday, bring gift
  introduce:     +1    // Introduce to useful connection
};
```

**Relationship Strain Effects:**
```javascript
function getSocialCapitalEffects(balance, relationshipLevel) {
  if (balance < -3) {
    return {
      strain: "high",
      effects: [
        "trust_decrease: -0.05/week",
        "less_available",
        "dialogue: 'You only call when you need something'"
      ]
    };
  } else if (balance < 0) {
    return {
      strain: "minor",
      effects: [
        "slightly_less_available",
        "dialogue: 'Sure... I guess I can help'"
      ]
    };
  } else if (balance > 5) {
    return {
      status: "great",
      effects: [
        "more_available",
        "dialogue: 'Anything for you!'",
        "may_offer_unprompted_help"
      ]
    };
  }
  
  return { status: "neutral" };
}
```

---

### 5. üò∞ Comfort Zone (Personality Stretch)

**Purpose:** Makes personality matter mechanically, enables growth

**How It Works:**
- Activities OUTSIDE your personality cost **Comfort Zone**
- This drains Emotional or Mental meters
- But it's also how personality GROWS
- Creates "should I?" tension

**Comfort Zone Calculation:**
```javascript
function getComfortZoneCost(activity, playerPersonality) {
  let cost = 0;
  let reasons = [];
  
  // Check Openness for NEW activities
  if (activity.tags.includes('new') && playerPersonality.openness < 3.0) {
    cost += (3.0 - playerPersonality.openness); // Max +3.0
    reasons.push("This is unfamiliar - makes you anxious");
  }
  
  // Check Extraversion for SOCIAL activities
  if (activity.socialLevel === 'high' && playerPersonality.extraversion < 3.0) {
    cost += (3.0 - playerPersonality.extraversion) * 0.5;
    reasons.push("Large groups drain you");
  }
  
  // Check Neuroticism for RISKY activities
  if (activity.risk === 'high' && playerPersonality.neuroticism > 3.5) {
    cost += (playerPersonality.neuroticism - 3.5);
    reasons.push("The uncertainty stresses you out");
  }
  
  return {
    cost: Math.round(cost * 10) / 10,
    reasons: reasons,
    growth_potential: cost > 0.5 ? "High - this will push you" : "Low"
  };
}
```

**Comfort Zone Costs Applied:**
```javascript
function applyComfortZoneCost(cost, emotionalMeter, mentalMeter) {
  // Cost distributed between Emotional and Mental
  const emotionalCost = Math.ceil(cost * 0.6);
  const mentalCost = Math.floor(cost * 0.4);
  
  return {
    emotional: emotionalMeter - emotionalCost,
    mental: mentalMeter - mentalCost,
    feedback: cost > 1.5 
      ? "This really pushed you out of your comfort zone" 
      : "A bit uncomfortable, but manageable"
  };
}
```

**Growth Reward:**
```javascript
function getPersonalityGrowth(comfortZoneCost, success) {
  if (!success) {
    return {
      growth: 0,
      message: "The failure reinforced your fears"
    };
  }
  
  if (comfortZoneCost > 1.5) {
    return {
      openness: +0.2,
      neuroticism: -0.1,
      message: "You proved to yourself you could do it"
    };
  } else if (comfortZoneCost > 0.5) {
    return {
      openness: +0.1,
      message: "Trying new things gets easier each time"
    };
  }
  
  return { growth: 0, message: "Within your comfort zone" };
}
```

---

### 6. üé≤ Success Chance (Probability-Based)

**Purpose:** Creates risk/reward decisions, skill progression matters

**Base Success Calculation:**
```javascript
function calculateSuccessChance(activity, player) {
  let baseChance = activity.baseSuccessRate || 0.7; // 70% default
  
  // Personality alignment
  if (activity.preferredPersonality) {
    const alignment = getPersonalityAlignment(
      activity.preferredPersonality,
      player.personality
    );
    baseChance += (alignment - 0.5) * 0.4; // ¬±20% from personality
  }
  
  // Skill level
  if (activity.relatedSkill) {
    const skillLevel = player.skills[activity.relatedSkill] || 0;
    baseChance += skillLevel * 0.05; // +5% per skill level (max +50% at Level 10)
  }
  
  // Emotional state
  const emotionalModifier = getEmotionalModifier(player.currentEmotion, activity);
  baseChance += emotionalModifier;
  
  // Meter effects
  if (player.meters.physical < 3) baseChance -= 0.1; // Exhausted
  if (player.meters.mental < 3) baseChance -= 0.1;   // Burned out
  
  // Clamp to 0.05-0.95 (always some chance of success/failure)
  return Math.max(0.05, Math.min(0.95, baseChance));
}
```

**Risk Modifiers:**
```javascript
const RISK_MODIFIERS = {
  play_it_safe: {
    success_modifier: +0.15,
    reward_modifier: 0.6,    // 60% of normal rewards
    description: "Lower risk approach"
  },
  
  standard: {
    success_modifier: 0,
    reward_modifier: 1.0,
    description: "Normal approach"
  },
  
  go_for_it: {
    success_modifier: -0.15,
    reward_modifier: 1.5,    // 50% bonus rewards
    description: "High risk, high reward"
  }
};
```

**Success/Failure Outcomes:**
```javascript
function resolveSuccessCheck(successChance) {
  const roll = Math.random();
  
  if (roll < successChance) {
    // SUCCESS
    return {
      result: "success",
      applyRewards: true,
      narrative: "success_narrative",
      emotionalImpact: "positive"
    };
  } else if (roll < successChance + 0.15) {
    // PARTIAL SUCCESS
    return {
      result: "partial",
      applyRewards: "reduced",
      narrative: "partial_narrative",
      emotionalImpact: "mixed"
    };
  } else {
    // FAILURE
    return {
      result: "failure",
      applyPenalties: true,
      narrative: "failure_narrative",
      emotionalImpact: "negative"
    };
  }
}
```

---

## Multi-Resource Cost Example

**Complete Card Example:**
```javascript
const HOT_YOGA_CARD = {
  id: "activity_hot_yoga_first_class",
  name: "Try Hot Yoga Class",
  type: "activity",
  tags: ["physical", "new", "social", "challenging"],
  
  costs: {
    energy: 2,
    time: 1.5,          // 90 minutes
    money: 25,          // First class fee
    comfort_zone: null, // Calculated based on personality
    social_capital: 0   // No social cost
  },
  
  baseSuccessRate: 0.40,  // 40% base (challenging!)
  
  successModifiers: {
    openness: { weight: 0.5, threshold: 3.0 },  // Low openness hurts
    physical_meter: { weight: 0.2, threshold: 5.0 },
    flexibility_skill: { weight: 0.3, per_level: 0.05 }
  },
  
  outcomes: {
    success: {
      meters: { physical: +2, mental: +1 },
      personality: { openness: +0.2 },
      unlocks: ["yoga_community_npcs", "yoga_studio_location"],
      emotional: "proud",
      narrative: "You did it! Sure, you fell over a few times, but everyone was supportive. You feel accomplished."
    },
    
    partial: {
      meters: { physical: +1, emotional: -1 },
      personality: { openness: +0.1 },
      emotional: "mixed",
      narrative: "You made it through class, but it was harder than expected. At least you tried."
    },
    
    failure: {
      meters: { emotional: -2 },
      money: -25,  // Still charged
      emotional: "embarrassed",
      narrative: "You left halfway through. Everyone saw you struggle. 'I knew this wasn't for me.'"
    }
  },
  
  modifiers_available: {
    bring_friend: {
      cost: { social_capital: -1 },  // Ask friend to come
      effect: { success: +0.20, comfort_zone: -0.5 }
    },
    
    take_beginner: {
      money: -15,  // Cheaper class
      success: +0.15,
      comfort_zone: -0.3
    }
  }
};
```

**Resolution Process:**
```javascript
async function resolveCard(card, player, modifiersChosen) {
  // 1. Calculate final costs
  const finalCosts = calculateCosts(card, player, modifiersChosen);
  
  // 2. Check if player can afford
  const canAfford = checkAffordability(player, finalCosts);
  if (!canAfford.success) {
    return {
      playable: false,
      blockers: canAfford.blockers,
      suggestions: canAfford.suggestions
    };
  }
  
  // 3. Deduct costs
  deductCosts(player, finalCosts);
  
  // 4. Calculate success chance
  const successChance = calculateSuccessChance(card, player);
  
  // 5. Roll for success
  const outcome = resolveSuccessCheck(successChance);
  
  // 6. Apply effects
  applyOutcome(player, card.outcomes[outcome.result]);
  
  // 7. Track for continuity
  trackEvent({
    card: card,
    outcome: outcome,
    week: player.currentWeek,
    emotionalWeight: getEmotionalWeight(outcome)
  });
  
  // 8. Return result
  return {
    success: true,
    outcome: outcome,
    narrative: generateNarrative(card, outcome, player),
    effects: card.outcomes[outcome.result]
  };
}
```

## Weekly Cycle Structure

**Turn Cadence:**
```javascript
const WEEKLY_STRUCTURE = {
  monday:    { type: "weekday", turns: 3, energy: [3,3,2], vibe: "routine" },
  tuesday:   { type: "weekday", turns: 3, energy: [3,3,2], vibe: "routine" },
  wednesday: { type: "weekday", turns: 3, energy: [3,3,2], vibe: "routine" },
  thursday:  { type: "weekday", turns: 3, energy: [3,3,2], vibe: "routine" },
  friday:    { type: "weekday", turns: 3, energy: [3,3,2], vibe: "anticipation" },
  saturday:  { type: "weekend", turns: 3, energy: [4,4,3], vibe: "freedom" },
  sunday:    { type: "weekend", turns: 3, energy: [4,4,3], vibe: "prep" }
};
```

**End of Week Processing:**
```javascript
function endOfWeekProcessing(player) {
  // 1. Financial deductions
  player.money -= WEEKLY_EXPENSES;
  
  // 2. Check neglected relationships
  checkRelationshipNeglect(player);
  
  // 3. Check meter extremes
  checkMeterCrises(player);
  
  // 4. Reset weekly time budget
  player.timeTracker.resetWeekly();
  
  // 5. Aspiration progress check
  checkAspirationMilestones(player);
  
  // 6. Generate next week preview
  return generateWeekPreview(player);
}
```

## Emotional Capacity Tracking Per Turn *(NEW - Master Truths v1.2)*

**Purpose:** Track NPC emotional capacity each turn to determine support availability.

```javascript
class TurnCapacityTracker {
  constructor() {
    this.npcCapacities = new Map();  // npcId ‚Üí capacity value
    this.playerCapacity = 0;
    this.lastUpdate = null;
  }
  
  // Called at START of each turn
  updateAllCapacities(player, npcs, environmentalContext) {
    const timestamp = Date.now();
    
    // Update player capacity
    this.playerCapacity = calculateEmotionalCapacity(
      player.meters,
      detectActiveStressors(player)
    );
    
    // Update each NPC capacity
    npcs.forEach(npc => {
      const npcCapacity = calculateEmotionalCapacity(
        npc.meters,
        detectActiveStressors(npc)
      );
      
      this.npcCapacities.set(npc.id, {
        capacity: npcCapacity,
        available_for_support: npcCapacity >= 4.0,  // Minimum threshold
        can_provide_light_support: npcCapacity >= 2.0,
        stressor_count: detectActiveStressors(npc).count,
        last_checked: timestamp
      });
    });
    
    this.lastUpdate = timestamp;
    
    return {
      player: this.playerCapacity,
      npcs: Array.from(this.npcCapacities.entries()),
      environmental_factors: environmentalContext
    };
  }
  
  // Check if NPC can provide support this turn
  canNPCSupport(npcId, playerNeedLevel) {
    const npcData = this.npcCapacities.get(npcId);
    if (!npcData) return { available: false, reason: "NPC not tracked" };
    
    const requiredCapacity = playerNeedLevel + 2.0;  // Master Truths v1.2 rule
    
    if (npcData.capacity >= requiredCapacity) {
      return {
        available: true,

## Circumstance Stacking Detection *(NEW - Master Truths v1.2)*

**Purpose:** Detect and track multiple simultaneous stressors affecting character state.

```javascript
function detectActiveStressors(character) {
  const stressors = {
    types: [],
    count: 0,
    severity: 'none',
    narrative: []
  };

      description: 'High work pressure/deadline'
    });
    stressors.narrative.push("Work is crushing you");
    stressors.count++;
  }
  
  // 2. MONEY STRESS
  if (character.money < 500 && character.rentDueDays <= 7) {
    stressors.types.push({
      type: 'money',
      severity: 10 - (character.money / 50),  // Lower money = higher severity
      description: 'Financial crisis - rent due soon'
    });
    stressors.narrative.push("Money is running out");
    stressors.count++;
  }
  
  // 3. RELATIONSHIP TENSION
  const strainedRelationships = character.relationships.filter(r => 
    r.socialCapital < -2 || r.trust < 0.3
  );

    stressors.types.push({
      type: 'health',
      severity: (4 - character.meters.physical) * 2,
      description: 'Physical health crisis'
    });
    stressors.narrative.push("Your body is giving up");
    stressors.count++;
  }
  
  // 5. FAMILY CRISIS
  if (character.familyCrisisActive) {
    stressors.types.push({
      type: 'family',
      severity: 8,
      description: character.familyCrisisType || 'Family emergency'
    });

      severity: 7,
      description: 'Housing situation unstable'
    });
    stressors.narrative.push("Housing is uncertain");
    stressors.count++;
  }
  
  // 7. ASPIRATION PRESSURE
  if (character.aspiration.deadline && 
      character.aspiration.progress < 0.5 &&
      character.aspiration.weeksRemaining < 4) {
    stressors.types.push({
      type: 'aspiration',
      severity: 6,
      description: 'Behind on life goals with deadline approaching'
    });
    stressors.narrative.push("Time is running out on your dreams");
    stressors.count++;
  }
  
  // Determine overall severity
  if (stressors.count === 0) {
    stressors.severity = 'none';
  } else if (stressors.count === 1) {
    stressors.severity = 'manageable';
  } else if (stressors.count === 2) {

  }
  
  return stressors;
}
```

- [x] **Tension injection frequency followed (Level 1-2: 1 in 3; Level 3-4: 1 in 2; Level 5: nearly every)**
- [x] **Dramatic irony mechanics used when knowledge gaps exist (score ‚â• 0.6)**
- [x] **Memory resonance factors applied to recall (weights: 0.7-0.95)**
- [x] **Novel-quality thresholds met (‚â• 0.7 overall; authenticity ‚â• 0.7; tension ‚â• 0.6; hooks ‚â• 0.6)**
- [x] This doc cites **Truths v1.2** at the top
