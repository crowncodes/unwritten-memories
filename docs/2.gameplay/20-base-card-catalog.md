# Base Card Catalog - Complete Implementation Reference

**Compliance:** master_truths_canonical_spec_v_1_2.md (v1.2)  
**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025  
**Purpose:** Complete catalog of all ~470 base cards with specifications for implementation

**References:**
- **Card Evolution:** `21-card-evolution-mechanics.md` (how cards evolve)
- **Fusion System:** `22-card-fusion-system.md` (how cards combine)
- **Design Philosophy:** `1.concept/11-card-system-basics.md` (WHY cards matter)

---

## Overview

**Unwritten launches with ~470 base cards** organized into 7 tiers by function and player control. Each card is a potential life experience that evolves uniquely based on player choices.

**Core Principle:** Cards are memory units. Generic base cards → personalized evolved cards → unique player story.

**Compliance:** All cards use canonical resources (Energy, Time, Money, Social Capital, Comfort Zone, Success Chance) and respect master_truths v1.1 systems.

---

## Card Taxonomy (7 Tiers)

### Organization Principle

Cards organized by:
1. **When/How They Enter Deck** (player-chosen, system-generated, event-triggered)
2. **Decision Weight** (life-altering, significant, routine, micro)
3. **Time Horizon** (affects 48+ weeks, 12 weeks, 1 week, 1 day)
4. **Gameplay Function** (framing, progression, structure, variety, resolution)

    };
  };
}
```

---

## Master Truths v1.2 Enhancements *(NEW)*

### Emotional Capacity Integration

Cards now respect emotional capacity constraints:

```javascript
// EXAMPLE: Tier 5 Event Card with Capacity Requirements
const CRISIS_SUPPORT_CARD = {
  id: "evt_support_friend_crisis",
  name: "Support Friend Through Crisis",
  tier: 5,
  
  costs: {
    time: 4,
    energy: 3,
    emotional_capacity: 2.5        // Consumes 2.5 capacity
  },
  
  emotional_capacity_requirements: {
    min_capacity: 4.0,              // Can't play if capacity < 4.0
    reduces_capacity: 2.5,          // Playing reduces capacity by 2.5
    requires_support: false         // Can do alone (but costs more)
  },
  
  effects: {
    relationship_trust: +0.25,
    friend_capacity: +2.0,          // Helps friend recover capacity
    emotional_meter: -1,            // Draining for player
    memory_weight: 9                // Highly significant memory
  },
  
  narrative_context: `
    [Friend Name] calls you. They're having a breakdown. You can tell this 
    is serious. Supporting them will take real emotional energy you might 
    not have right now.
  `,
  
  // If player capacity too low, show modified option
  low_capacity_alternative: {
    name: "Be There (But Limited)",
    min_capacity: 2.0,
    effects: {
      relationship_trust: +0.10,    // Less effective support
      friend_capacity: +1.0,
      player_capacity: -1.5,        // Still draining
      guilt: +1                     // Feels bad for not doing more
    }
  }
};
```

### Memory Resonance Examples

Cards can trigger past memories, affecting player response:

```javascript
// EXAMPLE: Activity Card with Memory Triggers
const VISIT_HOSPITAL_CARD = {
  id: "act_visit_hospital",
  name: "Visit [NPC] at Hospital",
  tier: 4,
  
  memory_resonance: {
    triggers_past_trauma: true,     // If player has hospital trauma memory
    emotional_callback: "hospital_visit_past",
    resonance_weight: 0.75          // 25% penalty to emotional state
  },
  
  // If player has hospital trauma in memory archive
  trauma_narrative: `
    You walk into the hospital. The smell hits you first—antiseptic, 
    fear, fluorescent lights. You remember when you were here for 
    [past trauma event]. Your chest tightens.
    
    You're here for [Friend]. You can do this. But it's hard.
  `,
  
  trauma_effects: {
    anxiety_state: "triggers ANXIOUS state if not already present",
    capacity_cost: "+1.0 (costs more when triggering trauma)",
    comfort_zone: +2,               // Extra courage required
    success_mod: -0.15              // Harder to be supportive
  },
  
  // Growth callback: if player has overcome hospital fear
  growth_narrative: `
    Hospitals used to terrify you. But you've been here before—for yourself, 
    for others. You're different now. Stronger. You walk in with purpose.
  `,
  
  growth_effects: {
    confidence_boost: +0.1,
    resonance_weight: 0.95,         // Positive reinforcement
    capacity_cost: "-0.5 (easier due to growth)"
  }
};
```

### Tension Injection Framework

Cards create narrative tension at appropriate frequencies:

```javascript
// EXAMPLE: Character Interaction with Tension Injection
const NPC_CONVERSATION_CARD = {
  id: "act_deep_conversation_sarah",
  name: "Deep Conversation with Sarah",
  tier: 4,
  relationship_level: 3,            // Friend level
  
  tension_injection: {
    frequency_by_level: {
      level_1_2: "1 in 3",          // Early relationship: sparse tension
      level_3_4: "1 in 2",          // Friend: regular tension
      level_5: "nearly every"       // Best friend: high tension (life is complex)
    }
  },
  
  // AT LEVEL 3 (Friend): 50% chance of tension element
  possible_tension_elements: [
    {
      type: "mystery_hook",
      trigger_chance: 0.15,
      narrative: `
        Sarah mentions "the anniversary" is coming up. She looks sad but 
        doesn't elaborate. You don't know what anniversary she means.
      `,
      creates_question: "What anniversary? Why does it make her sad?",
      reveals_later: "Anniversary of David's death (Level 4 reveal)"
    },
    
    {
      type: "partial_reveal",
      trigger_chance: 0.20,
      narrative: `
        "I almost told you something today," Sarah says as you're leaving. 
        "But I'm not ready yet. Soon, maybe."
      `,
      creates_tension: "What is she hiding? Should I push?"
    },
    
    {
      type: "stakes_escalation",
      trigger_chance: 0.15,
      narrative: `
        "I might have to move," Sarah says quietly. "For work. Nothing's 
        decided yet, but... I wanted you to know it's possible."
      `,
      creates_stakes: "Could lose this friendship if she moves",
      affects_future: "Move decision becomes subplot"
    }
  ],
  
  // No tension 50% of the time - normal, pleasant interactions matter too
  baseline_narrative: `
    Coffee with Sarah. Good conversation. She recommends a book. 
    You talk about work. Comfortable. This is what friendship feels like.
  `
};
```

## Compliance Checklist (Master Truths v1.2)

- [x] Uses canonical vocab & scales (Levels 0–5; Trust 0.0–1.0; Capacity 0.0-10.0; EXHAUSTED/OVERWHELMED)
- [x] Season = 12/24/36w (player choice at season start); 3 turns/day

- [x] Level-up requires BOTH interaction count AND trust threshold
- [x] Currencies limited to Time/Energy/Money/Social Capital
- [x] Decisive decisions pause time; copy avoids FOMO framing
- [x] Packs classified (Standard/Deluxe/Mega) with counts
- [x] Archive policy respected by tier

- [x] NPC personality/memory constraints respected
