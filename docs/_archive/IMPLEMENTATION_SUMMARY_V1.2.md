#### Emotional Authenticity (Expanded from ~500 to ~1,800 words)
- Detailed capacity scale documentation (0.0-10.0)
- X+2 support rule with mathematical examples
- Capacity factors table with specific impacts
- Four capacity tier behaviors with examples:
  - Crisis (0-1/10): Cannot provide ANY support
  - Low (2-4/10): Acknowledgment only
  - Medium (5-7/10): Moderate support, time-limited
  - High (8-10/10): Full deep support
- Added fields: `base_capacity`, `capacity_factors`, `effective_capacity`, `demonstrates_constraint`
- Increased from 2 to 4 high-quality examples

#### Dramatic Irony (Enhanced)
- Added `knowledge_gap_score` field (â‰¥0.6 threshold)
- Capacity-linked response selection
- Added `player_overlay` UI text
- Added `irony_type` taxonomy (including `capacity_limited_perception`)
- Two complete examples with all three response paths

#### Tension Building (Enhanced)
- Four canonical types: mystery_hook, partial_reveal, contradiction, stakes_escalation
- Frequency guidelines per relationship level
- Payoff timelines (2-4 weeks, 5-8 weeks)
- Added `information_debt`, `hook_effectiveness`, `player_curiosity_score` fields
- Four examples (one per tension type)

#### Memory Resonance (NEW v1.2)
- **New method**: `generate_memory_resonance_batch()`
- Five resonance types with canonical weights:
  1. Same Emotion, Different Context (0.8)
  2. Opposite Emotion, Growth (0.9)
  3. Past Trauma Trigger (0.95 - highest)
  4. Joy/Sadness Contrast (0.85)
  5. Emotional Growth Callback (0.7)
- Psychological explanation for memory recall
- Literary quality "catching your breath" moments
- Five complete examples

#### Validation (Enhanced)
- Updated `validate_with_qwen3_32b()` to check 5 Master Truths metrics
- Added explicit X+2 rule checking
- Added `meets_v1_2_standards` boolean flag
- Added specific issue tracking

#### Production Cycle (Updated)
- Added Memory Resonance generation loop
- Updated batch calculations for all 6 data types
- Changed output directory to `training_output_v1.2`
- Added Master Truths v1.2 metadata to all saved files

### 3. Enhanced Runner Script (`scripts/run_training_pipeline.py`)

**Status**: âœ… Replaced

**Key Features**:
- Added `display_spec_compliance()` showing all v1.2 systems and thresholds
- Shows 6 data types with priority emojis:
  - ðŸŽ­ Core (Emotional Authenticity)
  - âš¡ High Priority (Dramatic Irony, Tension Building)
  - ðŸ†• New v1.2 (Memory Resonance)
  - ðŸ“š Foundation (Personality, Relationship)
- Displays canonical constants (X+2 rule, tension frequencies, resonance weights)
- Shows quality thresholds per Master Truths v1.2
- Updated estimates for 9,200 daily samples
- Enhanced next steps with specific threshold checks

### 4. New Analysis Script (`scripts/analyze_training_data.py`)

**Status**: âœ… Created

**Comprehensive Features**:
- Load and combine all batch files
- Analyze quality metrics per data type
- Validate capacity constraints (X+2 rule violations)
- Filter samples by quality threshold
- Export by data type
- Generate train/validation/test splits (80/10/10)

**Command Line Interface**:
```bash
# Analyze quality
python scripts/analyze_training_data.py training_output_v1.2 --analyze

# Validate X+2 rule
python scripts/analyze_training_data.py training_output_v1.2 --validate-capacity

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Linting
- All files pass linter with no errors
- Code follows project standards

### Ready for Testing:
1. **Verify imports**:
   ```python
   from unwritten.training.config import TrainingConfig
   from unwritten.training.qwen3_generator import Qwen3DataGenerator
   ```

2. **Test config validation**:
   ```python
   config = TrainingConfig()
   config.validate()
   # Should print: âœ… Configuration validated (Master Truths v1.2 compliant)
   ```

3. **Run test generation**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_training_pipeline.py
   # Select option 1 (1 hour test run)
   ```

4. **Check output**:
   - Files appear in `training_output_v1.2/`
   - Each file has `master_truths_version: "v1.2"` metadata

5. **Test analysis**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/analyze_training_data.py training_output_v1.2 --analyze
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Run Test Generation**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_training_pipeline.py
   # Select option 1 for 1-hour test run
   ```

2. **Manual Quality Check**:
   - Review first 5-10 samples from each data type
   - Verify X+2 rule is followed in emotional_authenticity
   - Check tension hooks create curiosity

3. **Run Full Analysis**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/analyze_training_data.py training_output_v1.2 --all --min-quality 0.7
   ```

4. **Production Run** (when ready):
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_training_pipeline.py
   # Select option 3 for 24-hour production run
   ```
