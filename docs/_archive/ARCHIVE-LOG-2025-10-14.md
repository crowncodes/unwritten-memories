## Active Documents (Kept in docs/)

### Critical Active Documents
- âœ… **CANONICAL-DECISIONS-LOG.md** - Active tracking, DO NOT ARCHIVE
- âœ… **master_truths_canonical_spec_v_1_2.md** - Current canonical spec
- âœ… **MASTER-TRUTHS-V1.2-CHANGES-SUMMARY.md** - Changelog reference

### Reference Documents
- ðŸ“š **master_truths_canonical_spec_v_1.md** - Previous version (v1.1)
- ðŸ“Š **ANALYSIS_Redundancy_Report.md** - Optional: Could archive if no longer needed

---

## Why Archive?

These documents were **completion summaries** that:
- âœ… Tracked work during implementation
- âœ… Documented decisions and rationale
- âœ… Ensured nothing was lost
- âœ… Provided specifications for integration

Now that work is complete and integrated, they serve as:
- Historical reference
- Decision audit trail
- Rationale documentation
- Future retrospectives

Keeping them in the archive (rather than main `docs/`) reduces clutter while preserving history.

## Archive Contents

See `docs/_archive/2025-10-14-enhancements/README.md` for:
- Full list of archived files
- Integration locations
- Current status of all work
- Cross-references to updated docs

---

## Next Steps

### For Future Work:
1. Continue using active documents (`CANONICAL-DECISIONS-LOG.md`)
2. Create new summaries for new enhancements
3. Archive completion summaries after integration
4. Maintain this archive log for future reference

### Optional Cleanup:
- Consider archiving `ANALYSIS_Redundancy_Report.md` if recommendations have been fully implemented
