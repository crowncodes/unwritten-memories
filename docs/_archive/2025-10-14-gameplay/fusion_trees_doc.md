## Fusion System Overview

### Core Principles

**Fusion Definition:** When two or more cards are played together in the same turn/context, they may generate a new evolved card that remembers the combination and creates emergent narrative possibilities.

**Fusion Types:**
- **Simple Fusion:** 2 cards → 1 evolved card
- **Complex Fusion:** 3+ cards → 1 unique fusion card
- **Chain Fusion:** Evolved card + new card → further evolution
- **Legendary Fusion:** Specific sequence of fusions → ultra-rare card
- **Conditional Fusion:** Cards + specific context → special fusion

**Key Mechanics:**
- Fusions are **permanent** for that playthrough
- Fusions are **unique** to player choices
- Fusions **remember** their origin cards
- Fusions can be **components** in future fusions
- Fusions **cannot** be undone (narrative permanence)

---

## Balance & Design Principles

### Fusion Balance Rules

**1. Accessibility Pyramid:**
```
Common Fusions (70%): Easy to discover, require 2 cards
Uncommon Fusions (20%): Require 3 cards or specific conditions
Rare Fusions (8%): Require 4+ cards or lengthy sequences
Legendary Fusions (2%): Require 20+ card sequences or perfect conditions
```

**2. Reward Proportionality:**
```
Effort Required ∝ Emotional Payoff

Simple Fusion → Nice moment
Complex Fusion → Memorable story beat
Legendary Fusion → Defining life moment
```

**3. No Dead-End Combinations:**
```
Every valid combination must:
- Create something narratively meaningful
- Advance at least one relationship/system
- Feel earned, not random
- Add to player's story
```

**4. Tragedy is Part of Story:**
```
Not all fusions are positive:
- Relationships can break
- Businesses can fail
- Dreams can end
- These create equally powerful cards
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**❌ Random Fusion:**
Cards that combine without narrative logic

**❌ Grinding Fusions:**
Requiring 100+ repetitions for legendary status

**❌ Pay-to-Fuse:**
Premium cards that fusion-gate story content

**❌ Incomprehensible Requirements:**
Players should intuit what combinations make sense

**✅ DO: Make fusions feel like natural story progression**
**✅ DO: Reward emotional investment, not mechanical grinding**
**✅ DO: Create "Aha!" moments when players discover rare fusions**
**✅ DO: Make legendary fusions feel legendary**
