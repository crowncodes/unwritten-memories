## Expansion Philosophy

### Core Principles

**Modular Enhancement, Not Fragmentation**
- Packs ADD content without replacing core experience
- Base game remains complete and satisfying (470+ cards)
- Packs integrate seamlessly with existing systems
- No "pay-to-win" or gated essential features

**Themed Coherence**
- Each pack has clear identity and purpose
- Cards within pack work together thematically
- Packs respect Life Direction filtering
- Content appears when contextually appropriate

**Respect Player Investment**
- Archives persist regardless of pack ownership
- Fusions work across base + pack content
- Books can be generated with or without packs
- Premium content is additive, not exclusive

**Ethical Monetization**
- Free tier provides complete experience
- Premium enhances but doesn't gate core gameplay
- Transparent pricing, no dark patterns
- Packs are optional passion expansion, not required

### How Packs Integrate

**Life Direction Filtering:**
```javascript
// Pack content respects core filtering system

if (playerLifeDirection === "Pursue Creative Fulfillment") {
  if (ownsPack("creative_arts")) {
    creativePack.cards.forEach(card => {
      card.appearanceWeight *= 3.0; // 3x more likely
    });
  }
  if (ownsPack("city_explorer")) {
    if (city_explorer.cards.category === "artistic") {
      card.appearanceWeight *= 2.0; // Gallery openings, art districts
    }
  }
}

if (playerLifeDirection === "Find Personal Freedom") {
  if (ownsPack("nature_adventure")) {
    naturePack.cards.appearanceWeight *= 3.0; // Perfect fit
  }
  if (ownsPack("luxury_travel")) {
    luxuryPack.cards.appearanceWeight *= 2.5; // Travel fits, luxury contextual
  }
}
```

**Emotional State Integration:**
```javascript
// Pack cards follow same emotional state rules

const packCard_galleryOpening = {
  category: "exploration",
  pack: "creative_arts",
  emotionalStateAppeal: {
    INSPIRED: 2.5,    // Highly appealing when inspired
    CURIOUS: 2.2,     // Great when curious
    EXHAUSTED: 0.3,   // Low appeal when exhausted
    ANXIOUS: 0.6      // Moderate anxiety about new spaces
  }
};
```

**Fusion Compatibility:**
```javascript
// Pack cards can fuse with base cards and each other

FUSION EXAMPLES:
[SARAH (base)] + [GALLERY OPENING (creative_arts pack)] + [JOY]
‚Üí "Perfect Art Evening" memory

[HIKING (nature pack)] + [MARCUS (base)] + [CHALLENGE EMOTION]

  base: 0.7,  // 70% base game cards
  packs: 0.3  // 30% pack cards (if owned)
};

function filterPackContent(player) {
  const direction = player.lifeDirection;
  const ownedPacks = player.packs;
  
  ownedPacks.forEach(pack => {
    pack.cards.forEach(card => {
      // Calculate compatibility
      const compatibility = getDirectionCompatibility(direction, card);
      
      if (compatibility > 0.7) {
        card.appearanceWeight *= 3.0; // High fit: 3x more
      } else if (compatibility > 0.4) {
        card.appearanceWeight *= 1.5; // Medium fit: 1.5x
      } else {
        card.appearanceWeight *= 0.5; // Low fit: half normal
      }
      
      // Still appears, just less frequently if low fit
      // Respects exploration and serendipity
    });
  });
}
