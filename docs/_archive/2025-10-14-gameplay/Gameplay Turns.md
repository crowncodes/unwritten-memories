**EXCELLENT.** This is the key design challenge. Let me redesign the system with proper risk/reward, pacing, and structure:

---

# **UNWRITTEN: COMPLETE TURN ECONOMY & PACING SYSTEM**

## **1. CARD COST SYSTEM (Multi-Resource)**

Every card has **multiple potential costs**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🧘 TRY HOT YOGA CLASS           │
│ Activity • Challenging          │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ That new studio is offering     │

│ COSTS:                          │

│ • -Emotional (embarrassed)      │
│ • -$25 (quit mid-class)         │
│ • "I knew this wasn't for me"  │
│                                 │
│ MODIFY ODDS:                    │
│ • Bring Friend: +20% (costs favor)│
│ • Take Beginner: +15% (different class)│
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **THE 6 RESOURCE TYPES:**

**1. ⚡ ENERGY** (Daily Pool)
- Morning: 3 Energy
- Afternoon: 3 Energy  
- Evening: 2 Energy
- Regenerates each phase
- "Exhausted" = can't play high-energy cards

**2. ⏰ TIME** (Weekly Budget)
- 168 hours/week total
- Work/Sleep = ~120 hours (fixed obligations)
- **48 flexible hours** to allocate
- Time scarcity creates choices
- Weekend = 32 of those hours

**3. 💰 MONEY** (Monthly Budget)
- Income from job (varies by career)
- Bills auto-deduct weekly
- Discretionary spending = player choice
- Running out = crisis cards appear

**4. 🤝 SOCIAL CAPITAL** (Relationship Currency)
- Asking favors costs this
- "Can you help me move?" = -2 Social Capital with that NPC
- Restored by reciprocal actions
- Prevents exploiting relationships

**5. 😰 COMFORT ZONE** (Personality Stretch)
- Cards outside personality = "Risk" cost
- Low Openness doing new things = Emotional cost
- High Neuroticism in chaos = Mental cost
- Growth happens here but it's draining

**6. 🎲 SUCCESS CHANCE** (Probability-Based)
- Some cards have failure states
- Personality affects odds
- Skills improve odds
- Can choose to "play it safe" or "take risks"

---

### **Week = 7 Turns, 3 Phases Each**

```
MONDAY - FRIDAY (Routine Days)
├─ Morning Turn (3 Energy)

│ DECLINE? Sarah: -0.5 relationship│
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **How Events Get Triggered:**

**1. NPC-Initiated (60%)**
- NPCs at certain relationship levels invite you
- Based on their personality + your interactions
- "Sarah throws parties because she's Extraverted and you've bonded"

**2. Location-Based (20%)**
- Venues announce events
- "Jazz Club: Open Mic Night Friday"
- You discover them by frequenting locations

**3. Aspiration-Linked (15%)**
- Quests generate events
- "Writing Workshop" appears if you're working on novel
- "Networking Mixer" if pursuing promotion

**4. Random Discovery (5%)**
- Truly unexpected opportunities
- "Stranger invites you to underground art show"
- Low probability, high reward

### **Weekly Special Event Cadence:**

```
Week 1-2: Learn the Routine
├─ 1 small event (coffee with someone)
└─ Build baseline

Week 3-4: Social Rhythm Emerges
├─ 1-2 events (dinner party, concert)
└─ Relationships deepen

Week 5+: Rich Social Calendar
├─ 2-4 event options per weekend
├─ Must choose: can't do everything
└─ FOMO creates interesting decisions
```

```

Weeks 1-12

SEASON 2: "BUILDING MOMENTUM"  
Weeks 13-24

SEASON 3: "PEAK COMPLEXITY"

SEASON 4: "LEGACY & TRANSITION"
Weeks 37-48+ (until you choose to end)
```

- Sets deck filtering for entire season

- New season begins with reflection

---

## **5. COMPLEX MULTI-STEP ASPIRATIONS**

### **Example: "GET PROMOTED"**

This is NOT a single card. It's a **Quest System** that generates many sub-cards:

```

│ ON SUCCESS: FUSION CARD  │
│ "Senior Manager You"     │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

### **Key Design Points:**

1. **Routine becomes efficient**
   - "Take Course" becomes weekly routine
   - Auto-resolves after first choice
   - Frees up mental energy for big moments

2. **Tradeoffs create drama**
   - Working late = miss Sarah's party
   - Player must decide priorities
   - NPCs remember neglect

3. **Variable pacing**
   - Some weeks = lots of small cards (coursework)
   - Some weeks = one big decision (present to executives)
   - Player controls intensity

---

## **6. PACING: ROUTINE VS. FREEFORM**

### **The Problem:**
- **Routine-heavy player:** Risks tedious repetition
- **Freeform player:** Too many micro-decisions slow game

### **The Solution: ADAPTIVE TIME FLOW**

#### **ROUTINE-HEAVY PLAYER (High Conscientiousness)**

**Turn Experience:**
```

**Pacing Aid: "INTERESTING ONLY" Filter**
```

"Interesting Only" Mode:

- Shows only: social, events, goals, choices
- Speeds up freeform play by 40%
```

## **7. DECISION WEIGHTS: EASY VS. HARD CHOICES**

### **Easy Decisions (Auto-Resolve Available):**
```
"Coffee at usual spot?" → [Yes] [Change]
"Go to work?" → [Yes] [Call in sick]  
"Sleep?" → [Yes] [Stay up late]
```
- Default option clear
- One-tap resolution
- Fast gameplay

### **Medium Decisions (Quick Choice):**
```
"Sarah texts: Want to grab lunch?"
↑ Yes - positive              
→ No - decline politely
↓ Maybe later - defer

(3 seconds to decide)
```

### **Major Decisions (Pause & Consider):**
```
┌──────────────────────────┐

## **9. PREVENTING SLOW PACE: SOLUTIONS**

### **Problem 1: Too Many Mundane Choices**

**Solution: Smart Defaults + Batch**
- Auto-resolve obvious choices (sleep, commute, routine meals)
- "Do your usual routine?" → [Yes] [Modify]
- Batch weekdays when nothing interesting happens

### **Problem 2: Repetitive Goal Actions**

**Solution: Progress Bars + Automation**
```
"Study for Course" (Week 2/8)
[AUTO-CONTINUE] [MODIFY SCHEDULE] [QUIT]

→ Auto-resolves each week
→ Player only intervenes if conflict arises
→ "Skip this week? You'll fall behind"
```

### **Problem 3: Freeform Too Granular**

**Solution: Time Skips Between Interesting Moments**
```
[NOTHING INTERESTING TODAY]

Skip to next meaningful moment:
→ Sarah's text (2 hours)
→ Weekend (3 days)
→ Next quest milestone (1 week)

[SKIP FORWARD]
```

### **Problem 4: Analysis Paralysis**

**Solution: Timer + Consequences**
```
Minor decisions: 10 second timer
→ Forces intuition over overthinking
→ Auto-chooses default if timer expires

Major decisions: No timer
→ Life-changing choices deserve reflection
```

## **FINAL SYSTEM SUMMARY**

**Cards have 6 cost types:** Energy, Time, Money, Social Capital, Comfort Risk, Success Chance

**Weekly structure:** 5 routine days + 2 event-heavy days

**12-week seasons:** Major aspirations with quest chains

**Complex goals** (promotion) = many sub-cards over time

**Routine players:** Batch processing, fast-forward, efficient

**Freeform players:** Granular choices, time skips between interesting moments

**Risk/reward:** Outside-comfort-zone actions = lower success chance, higher growth rewards

**Special events:** NPC-initiated, location-based, aspiration-linked, random (60/20/15/5%)

This creates a game where:
✅ Both playstyles feel good
✅ Routine doesn't equal boring
✅ Freedom doesn't equal overwhelming
✅ Every choice has weight
✅ Pacing adapts to player behavior
✅ Growth requires risk
✅ Long-term goals stay engaging
