## System Overview

### Core Principles

**Cards Are Memory Units**
- Every card represents a potential life experience
- Cards evolve based on player choices and AI interpretation
- Evolved cards are unique to each playthrough
- Cards fuse to create compound memories

**Organic Taxonomy**
- Cards organized by **when/how they enter your deck**, not arbitrary categories
- Tiers based on **player control** and **time impact**
- System creates natural game pacing and meaningful choice hierarchy

**Evolution Through Play**
- Base cards (generic) → Evolved cards (personalized)
- AI generates unique variations based on context
- Personality, relationships, and history shape evolution
- Fusions create emergent narrative possibilities

---

## Card Taxonomy

### Tier System Organization

Cards are organized by:
1. **When/How They Enter Your Deck** (player-chosen, system-generated, event-triggered)
2. **Decision Weight** (life-altering, significant, routine, micro)
3. **Time Horizon** (affects next 48 weeks, 12 weeks, 1 week, 1 day)
4. **Gameplay Function** (framing, progression, structure, variety, resolution)

## Fusion System

### Fusion Principles

**What Creates Fusions:**
1. **Card Combinations:** Playing 2+ cards together in context

4. **Milestone Achievements:** Completing aspirations or challenges

**Fusion Properties:**
- **Permanent:** Once created, fusion exists for that playthrough
- **Unique:** Your fusion is personalized by your choices
- **Memorable:** Fusions remember their origin story
- **Compoundable:** Fusions can fuse with other cards
- **Irreversible:** Cannot undo fusions (narrative permanence)

## Integration with Core Systems

### Emotional State System Integration

**How Emotional States Filter Cards:**

```javascript
function drawHandWithEmotionalFiltering(
  availableCards,
  emotionalStates,
  personality
) {
  const { primary, secondary, intensity } = emotionalStates;
  
  // STEP 1: Apply emotional state appeal multipliers
  const filteredCards = availableCards.map(card => ({
    card: card,
    appealScore: calculateAppeal(card, primary, secondary),
    emotionalContext: getContext(card, primary)
  }));
  
  // STEP 2: Sort by appeal (high appeal = more likely)
  const weightedPool = filteredCards
    .filter(c => c.appealScore > 0.3) // Minimum threshold
    .sort((a, b) => b.appealScore - a.appealScore);
  
  // STEP 3: Weighted random draw
  const hand = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    const drawn = weightedRandomDraw(weightedPool);
    drawn.card.emotional_modifier = drawn.emotionalContext;
    hand.push(drawn.card);
  }
  
  return hand;
}
```

**Emotional State Examples:**

**OVERWHELMED State:**
- **Reduces Appeal:** Work cards, aspirations, high-demand activities

**MOTIVATED State:**
- **Increases Appeal:** Aspiration progress, work tasks, challenges

- **Modifies Rewards:** Progress bonuses +20%
- **Available Options:** More goal-oriented cards

**CURIOUS State:**
- **Increases Appeal:** Exploration, learning, new NPCs, questions
- **Reduces Appeal:** Routine, familiar patterns
- **Modifies Outcomes:** Discovery bonuses, Openness gains
- **Available Options:** More novelty cards

### Personality System Integration

**Personality Affects:**

**CARD APPEARANCE FREQUENCY:**
```javascript
const deckWeights = {

## Design Principles

### 1. **Organic Taxonomy Over Arbitrary Categories**
Cards organized by gameplay function (when/how they appear) not arbitrary labels

### 2. **Player Agency with Constraints**
You choose aspirations and activities, but life (obligations, events, NPCs) happens to you

### 3. **Evolution Through Play**
Every card can become unique through context, choices, and AI generation

### 4. **Fusion Creates Emergence**
Simple combinations create complex, personal narratives

### 5. **Emotional Authenticity**
Emotional states affect what appeals to you, mimicking real decision-making

### 6. **Personality Matters**
Your Big 5 personality shapes what cards appear and succeed

### 7. **Archive Permanence**
Every significant moment preserved, creating narrative continuity

### 8. **Integration Not Isolation**
All systems (emotional state, personality, archive, fusion) work together
