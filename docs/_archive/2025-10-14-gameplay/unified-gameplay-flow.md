## Gameplay Philosophy

### Core Principles

**Life Simulation, Not Optimization Puzzle**
- Emotional authenticity over mechanical efficiency
- Sometimes the "right" choice doesn't feel appealing
- Managing your emotional state IS gameplay
- Balance creates breakthrough, imbalance creates crisis

**Respect Both Playstyles**
- **Routine-builders:** Batch processing, automation, efficiency
- **Explorers:** Granular choices, variety, discovery
- Both are valid, both feel good

**Meaningful Scarcity**
- Limited time, energy, and emotional bandwidth
- Tradeoffs create interesting decisions
- You can't do everything‚Äîwhat matters most?

**Dynamic Difficulty Through State**
- Your emotional state affects what's appealing and possible
- Some days everything feels easy (MOTIVATED state)
- Other days everything feels hard (OVERWHELMED state)
- This mimics real life authentically

## Resource Management System

### The Six Resource Types

Every card and activity costs some combination of these resources:

#### 1. ‚ö° ENERGY (Daily Pool)

**Regeneration Pattern:**
```
MORNING (6am-12pm):   3 Energy available
AFTERNOON (12pm-6pm): 3 Energy available
EVENING (6pm-12am):   2 Energy available
NIGHT (12am-6am):     0 Energy (sleep time)

WEEKEND BONUS:
Saturday/Sunday:      +1 Energy per phase
```

**Energy Costs:**
- **Low (1 Energy):** Coffee, reading, casual social, browsing
- **Medium (2-3 Energy):** Work projects, exercise, cooking, meaningful social
- **High (4+ Energy):** Intense work, crisis response, challenging social, risky activities

**Emotional State Modifiers:**
```javascript
if (state === "EXHAUSTED") {
  allEnergyCosts += 1; // Everything costs more
  maxEnergy *= 0.7;    // Less total available
}
if (state === "MOTIVATED") {
  workActivities.energyCost -= 1; // Work feels easier
}
if (state === "ANXIOUS") {
  socialActivities.energyCost += 1; // Social feels draining
}
```

**Zero Energy Consequences:**
- Can only play obligation cards (must do)
- Quality of work suffers (-20% success rates)
- Higher chance of mistakes/conflicts
- Emotional stat drops (-1 per turn at zero energy)
- May trigger EXHAUSTED emotional state

---

#### 2. ‚è∞ TIME (Weekly Budget)

**Time Allocation:**
```
TOTAL: 168 hours/week

FIXED OBLIGATIONS:
- Sleep: 56 hours (8hr/night)
- Work: 40-50 hours
- Essential tasks: 14 hours (meals, hygiene, commute)
SUBTOTAL: 110-120 hours

DISCRETIONARY TIME: 48-58 hours/week
This is YOUR time to allocate
```

**Time Costs:**
- **Micro (15-30 min):** Quick coffee, phone call, snack
- **Short (1-2 hours):** Meal, gym session, social meetup, hobby
- **Medium (3-4 hours):** Work project, event, activity cluster
- **Long (5+ hours):** Major event, day trip, intensive project

**Weekend Concentration:**
- ~32 of your 48 flexible hours are weekend
- Weekdays = mostly evenings (2-3 hours available)
- Weekends = full days (8-12 hours available per day)

**Parallel Activities:**
- Some activities can combine (podcast while commuting)
- Some must be exclusive (can't work and party simultaneously)
- Routines optimize time (batch similar activities)

#### 3. üí∞ MONEY (Monthly Budget)

**Income Sources:**
```
CAREER DEPENDENT:
- Entry Level: $3,000-4,500/month
- Mid Career: $5,000-8,000/month
- Senior Level: $8,000-15,000/month
- Business Owner: $0-20,000/month (variable)

SIDE INCOME:
- Skills/freelance: $200-2,000/month
- Passive: $0-500/month
```

**Fixed Expenses (Auto-Deduct):**
```
MONTHLY BILLS:
- Rent/Mortgage: $1,200-2,500
- Utilities: $150-250
- Insurance: $200-400
- Debt Payments: $0-800
- Transportation: $150-400
- Food (base): $300-500
TOTAL: $2,000-4,850/month

DISCRETIONARY: Remaining after bills
```

**Activity Costs:**
- **Free:** Park, home activities, some social
- **Low ($5-20):** Coffee, fast food, movies, basic entertainment
- **Medium ($20-100):** Dinner out, event tickets, hobby supplies
- **High ($100-500):** Weekend trip, major purchase, luxury experience
- **Major ($500+):** Vacation, business investment, life changes

**Financial Crisis Triggers:**
- Savings < Rent cost = Crisis card imminent
- Missing bill payment = Credit impact, stress
- Debt > 40% income = Limited options appear
- Bankruptcy possible if mismanaged

---

#### 4. ü§ù SOCIAL CAPITAL (Relationship Currency)

**What It Represents:**
- Your ability to ask favors
- Goodwill in relationships
- Reciprocity balance
- Trust reservoir

**Earning Social Capital:**
```
ACTIONS THAT BUILD:
- Help friend move: +2 with that person
- Remember birthday: +0.5
- Show up when needed: +3
- Introduce friends: +1 each
- Support during crisis: +5

NATURAL REGENERATION:
+0.1 per week in established relationships
(Friendship maintenance through existence)
```

**Spending Social Capital:**
```
COSTS:
- Ask help moving: -2
- Borrow money: -4
- Cancel plans last minute: -3
- Need emotional support: -1
- Introduce to your friends: -1
- Ask professional favor: -3
```

**Zero Social Capital:**
- NPCs decline requests
- "Sorry, I'm busy" responses
- Relationship strain appears
- Must rebuild through giving first

**Negative Social Capital:**
- Relationship at risk
- Confrontation cards appear
- May lose friendship if not repaired
- "We need to talk" events trigger

---

#### 5. üò∞ COMFORT ZONE (Personality Stretch)

**What It Represents:**
- Emotional cost of going against personality
- Growth happens here, but it's draining
- Higher cost = more anxiety/discomfort

**Calculating Comfort Risk:**
```javascript
function calculateComfortRisk(card, personality) {
  let risk = 0;
  
  // OPENNESS CHECK
  if (card.category === "novel_experience") {
    if (personality.openness < 3.0) {
      risk += 2; // High discomfort
    }
  }
  
  // EXTRAVERSION CHECK
  if (card.category === "social_performance") {
    if (personality.extraversion < 3.0) {
      risk += 2; // High discomfort
    }
  }
  
  // NEUROTICISM CHECK
  if (card.category === "risky_uncertainty") {
    if (personality.neuroticism > 4.0) {
      risk += 3; // Extreme discomfort
    }
  }
  
  return risk; // 0-5 scale
}
```

**Comfort Risk Effects:**
```
RISK 0: No discomfort, natural fit
RISK 1: Slight stretch, manageable
RISK 2: Moderate discomfort, Energy +1
RISK 3: High discomfort, Energy +2, Emotional -1
RISK 4: Extreme discomfort, Energy +3, Emotional -2
RISK 5: Near-impossible, may fail even if attempted
```

**Growth Reward:**
- Successfully completing high comfort risk cards
- Personality shift toward that trait
- Example: Introvert does public speaking (Risk 4)
  - If success: Extraversion +0.3
  - Unlock: More confidence in similar situations
  - Memory: "I did the scary thing"

#### 6. üé≤ SUCCESS CHANCE (Probability-Based)

**Success Influenced By:**
1. **Personality Fit** (30% weight)
2. **Skill Level** (25% weight)
3. **Emotional State** (20% weight)
4. **Preparation** (15% weight)
5. **Random Chance** (10% weight)

**Success Formula:**
```javascript
function calculateSuccessChance(card, player) {
  let baseChance = card.base_difficulty; // 0.5 typical
  
  // PERSONALITY FIT
  const personalityMatch = getPersonalityMatch(card, player.personality);
  baseChance += personalityMatch * 0.3; // -0.3 to +0.3
  
  // SKILL LEVEL
  if (card.required_skill) {
    const skillLevel = player.skills[card.required_skill];
    baseChance += (skillLevel / 10) * 0.25; // 0 to +0.25
  }
  
  // EMOTIONAL STATE
  const stateModifier = getStateModifier(card, player.emotional_state);
  baseChance += stateModifier; // -0.2 to +0.2
  
  // PREPARATION
  if (card.preparation_cards_completed) {
    baseChance += 0.15; // Prepared = better odds
  }
  
  // CLAMP
  return Math.max(0.05, Math.min(0.95, baseChance));
}
```

**Outcome Distribution:**
```
SUCCESS (60%+): Good outcome, rewards as expected
PARTIAL SUCCESS (20-60%): Mixed results, some progress
FAILURE (5-20%): Setback, loss of resources
CRITICAL FAILURE (<5%): Disaster, major consequences
```

**Player Can Modify:**
- Preparation cards: +10-20% success
- Bring friend: +10-15% success
- Optimal emotional state: +10-20% success
- Skill training: +5% per level
- Choose easier variant: Guaranteed success but lower rewards

## Emotional State-Driven Gameplay

### State Detection System

**Every Turn Begins With State Analysis:**

```javascript
function determineEmotionalState(player, context) {
  // STEP 1: CRISIS OVERRIDE
  if (player.meters.mental < 3) return "EXHAUSTED";
  if (player.meters.emotional < 3) return "DISCOURAGED";
  if (player.meters.physical < 3) return "DRAINED";
  
  // STEP 2: RECENT EVENTS
  const recentPositive = context.recentEvents.filter(e => e.valence > 0.7);
  const recentNegative = context.recentEvents.filter(e => e.valence < -0.7);
  const recentStress = context.recentEvents.filter(e => e.stress > 0.5);
  
  if (recentPositive.length >= 3) return weightedChoice(["EXCITED", "CONFIDENT", "GRATEFUL"]);
  if (recentNegative.length >= 3) return weightedChoice(["DISCOURAGED", "MELANCHOLY", "FRUSTRATED"]);
  if (recentStress.length >= 2) return "OVERWHELMED";
  
  // STEP 3: ASPIRATION PROGRESS
  if (player.aspiration.progress > 0.7 && player.aspiration.deadline < 3) {
    return "MOTIVATED";
  }
  if (player.aspiration.progress < 0.3 && player.aspiration.deadline < 5) {
    return "ANXIOUS";
  }
  
  // STEP 4: PERSONALITY BASELINE
  if (player.personality.neuroticism > 4.0) {
    return weightedChoice(["ANXIOUS", "OVERWHELMED", "RESTLESS"]);
  }
  if (player.personality.openness > 4.0) {
    return weightedChoice(["CURIOUS", "INSPIRED", "EXCITED"]);
  }
  
  // STEP 5: DEFAULT
  return "CONTENT";
}

### State Affects Everything

**HAND COMPOSITION:**
```javascript
// OVERWHELMED Example
const hand_overwhelmed = {
  work_tasks: 0.4,        // Appear less (too much)
  rest_activities: 2.5,   // Appear much more (needed)
  support_seeking: 2.0,   // Social support cards increased
  avoidance: 1.5,         // Temptation cards (scrolling, etc)
  aspirations: 0.3        // Goal cards disappear (can't handle)
};

// MOTIVATED Example
const hand_motivated = {
  work_tasks: 2.0,        // Appear more (feel capable)
  aspirations: 2.5,       // Goal cards prominent
  rest_activities: 0.3,   // Rest cards disappear (don't need)
  social_casual: 0.7,     // Less social (focused on goals)
  challenges: 1.8         // Willing to take on more
};
```

**ENERGY COSTS:**
```javascript
if (state === "EXHAUSTED") {
  allActivities.energyCost += 1;
  maxEnergyPool *= 0.7;
}

if (state === "MOTIVATED") {
  aspirationActivities.energyCost -= 1;
  workActivities.energyCost -= 1;
}

if (state === "ANXIOUS") {
  socialActivities.energyCost += 1;
  riskActivities.energyCost += 2;
}
```

**SUCCESS CHANCES:**
```javascript
const stateModifiers = {
  CONFIDENT: { challenges: +0.15, performance: +0.20, risk: +0.10 },
  ANXIOUS: { challenges: -0.10, social: -0.05, risk: -0.20 },
  INSPIRED: { creative: +0.30, artistic: +0.25, novel: +0.15 },
  EXHAUSTED: { everything: -0.20, demanding: -0.40 },
  OVERWHELMED: { complex: -0.25, work: -0.15, decisions: -0.10 }
};
```

---

### State Transitions

**States Change Based on Actions:**

```javascript
// EXAMPLE: Morning Run While OVERWHELMED

BEFORE:
State: OVERWHELMED (Primary)
Meters: Mental 3, Physical 6, Emotional 4

ACTION: Quick Run
- Time: 45 minutes
- Energy: -2
- Physical: +1
- Mental: +1 (stress relief)
- Emotional: +1 (endorphins)

AFTER:
State: RESTLESS ‚Üí MOTIVATED (Transition)
Meters: Mental 4, Physical 7, Emotional 5
Reasoning: "Physical activity channeled anxiety into productive energy"

GAMEPLAY EFFECT:
- Afternoon hand draws different cards
- More goal-oriented options appear
- Aspiration activities feel appealing again
- Player "turned the day around"
```

**State Persistence:**
```
TEMPORARY STATES (1-3 turns):
- Excited (after good news)
- Frustrated (after setback)
- Inspired (creative breakthrough)

PERSISTENT STATES (3-10 turns):
- Anxious (ongoing stress)
- Motivated (goal progress)
- Content (sustained balance)

CHRONIC STATES (10+ turns):
- Exhausted (burnout)
- Discouraged (repeated failure)
- Balanced (mastery achieved)
```

## Flow Optimization

### Preventing Slow Pace

**PROBLEM 1: Too Many Mundane Decisions**

SOLUTION: Smart Defaults + Batch Processing
```javascript
// Automatic decisions for established patterns
if (card.isRoutine && player.preferredChoice) {
  autoResolve(card, player.preferredChoice);
  return "Auto-resolved: Coffee at Maya's (+1 Energy, 20min, $6.50)";
}

// Batch similar cards
if (weekdayRoutine.established && player.confirmBatch) {
  batchResolve(weekdayRoutine, 5); // M-F
  return "Resolved: Standard work week ‚Üí Friday afternoon";
}
```

**PROBLEM 2: Repetitive Goal Actions**

SOLUTION: Progress Bars + Automation

```

**PROBLEM 3: Analysis Paralysis**

SOLUTION: Timer + Visual Simplification
```
MINOR DECISIONS: 10-second soft timer
- Not enforced, but creates gentle urgency
- "Trust your gut" moment
- Auto-default if timer expires (safe choice)

MAJOR DECISIONS: No timer
- Life-changing deserves reflection
- Full information available
- Visual impact preview
```

**PROBLEM 4: Too Much Text**

SOLUTION: Progressive Disclosure
```

## Summary

The Unified Gameplay Flow creates **authentic life simulation** through:

1. **Six Resource Types** creating meaningful scarcity and tradeoffs
2. **Three-Turn Daily Structure** respecting real-life rhythm
3. **Emotional State-Driven Gameplay** mimicking authentic decision-making
4. **12-Week Season Arcs** providing narrative structure and progression
5. **Adaptive Pacing** respecting both routine-builders and explorers
6. **Tiered Decision Weight** focusing attention on what matters
7. **Smart Automation** removing tedium without removing agency
8. **Time Management** that feels authentic not mechanical

**Result:** A game that feels like **living a life** rather than **playing a game**, where:
- Some days everything clicks (MOTIVATED state, high energy)
- Other days everything is hard (EXHAUSTED state, crisis mode)
- Your personality shapes what appeals to you
- Emotional states evolve based on your choices
- Balance creates breakthrough, imbalance creates crisis
- Every season tells a complete, emotionally resonant story

The system creates space for both **efficiency** (routine players) and **exploration** (variety seekers) while maintaining **emotional authenticity** through state-driven gameplay that mirrors real human experience.
