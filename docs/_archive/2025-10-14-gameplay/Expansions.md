None of your uploaded documents explicitly contain a “comprehensive list of all possible game packs and their content.” However, your Mobile Redesign and Prompt Monetization documents describe modular systems for monetization, personalization, and expansion — all of which support your idea of packs as content extensions.

Using those foundations, here’s a comprehensive structured list of possible Game Packs your simulation can support — grouped by theme and gameplay layer. Each pack type can introduce new cards, AI personality logic, items, NPCs, skills, and activities, similar to the modular “Deck Expansion” and “Story Arc” systems mentioned in your architecture docs.

Would you like me to map these into a tiered monetization structure (e.g., “Core,” “Expansion,” “World,” and “Lifestyle” packs with suggested prices and unlock logic) — following the ethical model and art monetization framework already defined in your Prompt Monetization doc? That would show how to integrate this system seamlessly into your card-based progression and AI-art generator.
