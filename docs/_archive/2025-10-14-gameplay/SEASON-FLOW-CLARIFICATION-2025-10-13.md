# Season Flow Clarification - October 13, 2025

## Issue Addressed

User requested clarification that the **multi-season flow** (8-10 season lifecycle, same character across seasons, time skips, Life Bookshelf) is clear and consistent across core gameplay specification documents.

**Problem:** Individual season mechanics docs (structure, acts, decisions) didn't clearly explain that characters persist across multiple seasons with all progress carrying forward.

## Files Updated

### 1. ✅ `40-season-structure-spec.md`

**Added:**
- **Multi-Season Context** in Overview section
- **"What Happens After a Season Ends?"** section with complete flow diagram
- Season limits (8 base, 10 with premium)
- Reference to `73-season-flow-implementation.md`

**Key Addition:**
```
Multi-Season Context: Each season is ONE CHAPTER in a character's life story. 
Characters persist across 8-10 seasons (Life Bookshelf), with all relationships, 
skills, and memories carrying forward.
```

---

### 2. ✅ `31-narrative-arc-scaffolding.md`

**Added:**
- **Multi-Season Context** in Overview section
- **"Multi-Season Narrative Continuity"** section
- Explanation of how 3-act structure applies to EACH season individually
- Narrative implications across seasons

**Key Addition:**
```
Multi-Season Context: This 3-act structure applies to EACH season individually. 
A character lives through 8-10 seasons total (their Life Bookshelf), with each 
season being one complete story arc. Between seasons, time can skip forward 
(months to years) with auto-generated narrative.
```

---

### 3. ✅ `30-decisive-decision-templates.md`

**Added:**
- **Multi-Season Context** in Overview section
- **"Multi-Season Decision Consequences"** section with complete example
- Design guidelines for legendary vs major decisions
- Multi-season memory and regret system tracking

**Key Addition:**
```javascript
const MULTI_SEASON_DECISION = {
  season: 2,
  decision: "Chose work over wedding shoot",
  
  carries_to_season_3: { /* ... */ },
  carries_to_season_5: { /* ... */ },
  carries_to_season_8: { /* ... */ }
};
```

**Design Guidelines Added:**
- Legendary decisions → Echo 3-6 seasons
- Major decisions → Echo 1-3 seasons
- Memory system tracks all decisions across character's life

---

### 4. ✅ `73-season-flow-implementation.md` (Already Complete)

**Status:** This document already contains the complete specification for:
- Season-to-season transitions
- Time skip system with auto-generated narrative
- Life Bookshelf (8-10 novels per character)
- Character retirement
- Multi-character system

**This serves as the canonical reference** for all multi-season mechanics.

## What's Now Clear Across All Docs

### The Multi-Season Model

**ONE CHARACTER** lives through **MULTIPLE SEASONS** (8-10 max):

```
CHARACTER LIFECYCLE
├─ Season 1: First chapter (12/24/36 weeks) → Novel generated
├─ TIME SKIP (auto-narrative)
├─ Season 2: Next chapter (12/24/36 weeks) → Novel generated
├─ TIME SKIP
├─ Season 3...
├─ ...
└─ Season 8-10: Final chapter → Character retired

RESULT: Life Bookshelf of 8-10 novels (120k-150k words total)
```

### Key Clarifications Now Explicit

1. **NOT a roguelike** - Characters don't reset or restart
2. **NOT disposable runs** - Each character is a long-term investment
3. **IS a life simulation** - Like The Sims, one character across life phases
4. **IS continuous storytelling** - Everything carries forward between seasons

### Cross-References Added

Each doc now references `73-season-flow-implementation.md` for complete multi-season details, creating a clear documentation hierarchy:

- **40-season-structure-spec.md** → Individual season structure (12/24/36 weeks)
- **31-narrative-arc-scaffolding.md** → Individual season narrative (3 acts)
- **30-decisive-decision-templates.md** → Individual decision mechanics
- **73-season-flow-implementation.md** → Multi-season lifecycle (8-10 seasons)

## Impact

### For Developers
- **Clear distinction** between single-season and multi-season mechanics
- **Explicit lifecycle** - know when characters end
- **Memory systems** - understand how to track across seasons

### For Narrative Designers
- **Long-term planning** - decisions can echo for 3-6 seasons
- **Character arcs** - design across multiple seasons
- **Time skip integration** - understand how narratives bridge seasons

### For Game Designers
- **Progression clarity** - 8-10 season lifecycle
- **Monetization tie-in** - +2 seasons for 500 Essence
- **Retirement systems** - know when characters must end

## Compliance

**master_truths v1.1:** ✅ All updates maintain compliance
- Seasons: 12/24/36 weeks (player choice)
- Characters: 8-10 seasons per character
- Relationship levels: 0-5
- Decisive decisions: Pause time, no FOMO

---

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Multi-season flow now clearly documented across all 4 gameplay spec files with consistent terminology and cross-references.

**Next:** Continue creating more 2.gameplay/ implementation specs (card system, fusion, etc.)
