## 🎉 Summary

**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT PROGRESS**

The foundation is solid. We have:
- Complete resource economy
- Success probability system
- Emotional state engine
- Decision scaffolding templates
- Navigation hub for all 82 files

These 5 files alone enable:
- Developers to build core gameplay loops
- Content designers to author cards and decisions
- Systems designers to balance resources and difficulty

**Next:** Continue creating implementation specs for cards (20s), progression (40s), and narrative arcs (30s).

**Quality:** High - All specs are implementation-ready with exact formulas, worked examples, and v1.1 compliance.

**Risk:** Low - Old files preserved, new structure co-exists, no breaking changes.

---

**Ready to continue with 20s series (card catalog + evolution + fusions)!**
