## 🔄 MULTI-SEASON FLOW CLARIFICATION (Latest Update)

**Issue:** Individual season specs didn't make it clear that characters persist across 8-10 seasons.

**Solution:** Added explicit multi-season context to all season-related specs:

1. **`40-season-structure-spec.md`** ✅
   - Added "Multi-Season Context" in overview
   - Added "What Happens After a Season Ends?" section
   - Explicit season limits (8 base, 10 premium)

2. **`31-narrative-arc-scaffolding.md`** ✅
   - Added "Multi-Season Narrative Continuity" section
   - Clarified 3-act structure applies to EACH season
   - Explained how arcs can span multiple seasons

3. **`30-decisive-decision-templates.md`** ✅
   - Added "Multi-Season Decision Consequences" section
   - Example of decision echoing across 6 seasons
   - Design guidelines for legendary vs major decisions

4. **`73-season-flow-implementation.md`** ✅
   - Already complete (canonical source)

**Impact:** Developers and designers now have clear understanding that Unwritten is a **life simulation** where ONE character lives through MULTIPLE seasons, not a roguelike with disposable runs.

**Documentation:** See `SEASON-FLOW-CLARIFICATION-2025-10-13.md` for complete details.
