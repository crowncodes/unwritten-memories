I'll search the project knowledge to find information about the base cards, categories, and turns.

Based on the project documents, I'll create a comprehensive list of all base cards organized by category. The system is designed to have **well over 300 base cards** that evolve during gameplay.

I've created a comprehensive catalog of **470+ base cards** organized by the tier system from your project documents. This well exceeds your target of 300+ cards!

The list includes:

- **9 Foundation Cards** (Life Direction choices)
- **~82 Aspiration Cards** (Major and Minor life goals)
- **~30 Routine & Obligation Cards** (Daily life necessities)
- **~150 Activity Cards** (Social, Solo, Exploration, and Challenge activities)
- **~60 Event Cards** (NPC-initiated, Random, Crisis, and Breakthrough moments)
- **~50 System Cards** (Skills, Items, and Perks)
- **50 Character Cards** (NPCs that evolve through play)
- **30 Location Cards** (Places that gain meaning over time)
- **20 Emotion Cards** (Emotional modifiers)

The beauty of your system is that these **470 base cards** then:
- **Evolve** uniquely based on each player's choices
- **Fuse** together to create thousands of combinations
- **Generate memory cards** automatically
- **Expand** through DLC packs

So while you start with ~470 base cards, each playthrough creates a completely unique deck of evolved cards, making the total possibility space enormous!
