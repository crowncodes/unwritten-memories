### 2. Card Evolution Mechanics (`21-card-evolution-mechanics.md` - 1800+ lines)

**Three evolution dimensions:**

**Relationship-Driven Evolution (NPCs):**
- Level 0 (Not Met) → Generic stranger
- Level 1 (First Meeting) → AI generates unique NPC (name, personality, appearance)
- Level 2 (Acquaintance) → More specific, references past interactions
- Level 3 (Friend) → Complete personality revealed, backstory hints
- Level 4 (Close Friend) → Major mystery revealed, deep trust
- Level 5 (Best Friend/Soulmate) → Unbreakable bond, life partner

**Time-Based Evolution (Locations, Activities):**
- Generic → Familiar (5 visits)
- Familiar → Routine (15 visits)
- Routine → Tradition (50+ visits)
- Tradition → Landmark (major moment occurred here)

**Event-Based Evolution (Crisis, Breakthrough):**
- Crisis creates permanent memory cards ("Remember When I Collapsed")
- Breakthrough creates perk cards ("Your Signature Style")
- Phase transitions create new possibilities

**AI Generation System:**
- Complete TensorFlow Lite integration spec
- Input: Player personality, emotional state, context, interaction history
- Output: Unique NPC with personality, appearance, backstory mystery, dialogue
- Portrait generation integration

**Multi-Season Persistence:**
- All evolutions carry forward across 8-10 seasons
- Sarah from Season 1 → Business Partner in Season 4 → Best Friend in Season 8

### 3. Card Fusion System (`22-card-fusion-system.md` - 2200+ lines)

**Five fusion types fully specified:**

**Simple Fusions (2 cards):**
- Character + Activity = Personalized Activity ("Coffee with Sarah")
- Character + Location = Personalized Place ("Café Luna - Sarah's Corner")
- Activity + Emotion = Colored Experience ("Inspired Photography Session")

**Complex Fusions (3 cards):**
- Character + Activity + Emotion = Landmark Memory ("Perfect Afternoon with Sarah")
- Character + Location + Time = Ritual Formation ("Sacred Tuesday Ritual")

**Chain Fusions (Progression):**
- Evolved card + New card → Deeper evolution
- Example: "Coffee" → "Ritual" → "Tradition" → "Sacred Memory"
- Multi-season progression chains

**Legendary Fusions (Ultra-Rare):**
- Specific 5+ card sequences over 100+ weeks
- Examples: "Creative Legacy," "Soulmate Bond"
- < 5% of players will complete

**Conditional Fusions (Context-Dependent):**
- Seasonal fusions (first snow, anniversary)
- Crisis fusions (support during collapse)
- Aspiration fusions (achievement memories)

**Mathematical Possibility Space:**
```
Base Cards:                ~480

## 🎯 What Developers Can Now Build

With these 3 specs, developers can implement:

### Core Card Engine
- Card data structures and TypeScript interfaces
- 7-tier taxonomy system
- Cost calculation (6 resource types)
- Effect application (meters, relationships, skills)
- Appearance filtering by conditions

### Evolution System
- AI integration for NPC generation
- Relationship-driven progression (0-5 levels)
- Time-based evolution tracking
- Event-triggered transformations
- Cross-season persistence

### Fusion System
- Automatic fusion detection (cards played together)
- Simple/complex/chain/legendary fusion logic
- Context-dependent fusion conditions
- Fusion memory and persistence
- Novel generation integration

### Integration Points
- Resource economy (6 resources)
- Relationship system (0-5 levels)
- Emotional states (20 states)
- Meter effects (4 meters)
- Success calculations (7 modifiers)
- Narrative arc system (3 acts)
- Season flow (12/24/36 weeks)
- Multi-season continuity (8-10 seasons)

---

## 🔗 System Integration

Card system integrates with **ALL major systems:**

✅ **Resource Economy** (`10-resource-economy-spec.md`)
- All cards use canonical 6 resources

✅ **Success Probability** (`12-success-probability-formulas.md`)
- Card success rates use standard formula

✅ **Meter Effects** (`13-meter-effects-tables.md`)
- Card effects modify 4 meters

✅ **Emotional States** (`14-emotional-state-mechanics.md`)
- Emotional state filters hand, affects fusion colors

✅ **Relationship Progression** (`44-relationship-progression-spec.md`)
- Character evolution uses 0-5 levels

✅ **3-Act Narrative** (`31-narrative-arc-scaffolding.md`)
- Cards create narrative beats

✅ **Season Flow** (`73-season-flow-implementation.md`)
- Cards persist across 8-10 seasons

✅ **Novel Generation** (`6.monetization/novel-generation-integration.md`)
- Evolved cards and fusions create novel content
