# Training Data Prompt Improvements v1.4 - The Sweet Spot

## Summary

**Problem:** v1.3 overcorrected - dialogue became too sparse (50-100 words), losing emotional depth and texture.

**Solution:** v1.4 finds the **sweet spot** at 60-120 words with integrated behavioral prose, not screenplay cues.

## The Quality Spectrum

### ❌ TOO MELODRAMATIC (v1.2 - 150-200 words)
```
"I... I wish I could be there for you, truly I do. [voice cracks] My hands 
are shaking so badly I can't even hold this coffee cup steady. [sighs deeply] 
You deserve someone who can show up fully, and right now, that's just not me. 
[looks away, tears forming] I'm drowning in my own problems..."
```
**Issues:** Screenplay cues, metaphors, overdramatic, 55+ words of stage directions

### ❌ TOO SPARSE (v1.3 - 50-100 words)
```
"I want to help. I do. But I can't right now. I'm sorry."
```
**Issues:** Too clinical, no context, no emotional depth, feels robotic

### ✅ THE SWEET SPOT (v1.4 - 60-120 words)
```
She stared at the message for a full minute before typing. "I care about you. 
You know I do. But I'm barely keeping my own head above water right now." 
Her thumb hovered over send. "I've got maybe half a tank left, and you need 
someone running on full. Can you call Maya? She's better at this than I am. 
I'm so sorry."
```
**Why this works:** 
- 70 words - enough for emotional depth
- Behavioral details integrated as prose (not [brackets])
- Specific without being exposition
- Emotional weight without melodrama
- Reads like a novel, not a screenplay

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Dialogue Length Adjusted
**Before (v1.3):** 50-100 words (too sparse)  
**After (v1.4):** 60-120 words (sweet spot)

**Why:** Need enough room for:
- Context establishment
- Emotional nuance
- Natural conversation flow
- Character depth

### 2. ✅ Behavioral Details INTEGRATED
**Before (v1.3):**
```json
"one_behavioral_cue": "Types, deletes, retypes message three times"
```

**After (v1.4):**
```json
"dialogue": "She stared at her phone for a long moment before responding...",
"behavioral_detail": "coffee sits untouched, going cold"
```

**Why:** 
- Prose integration feels natural, not script-like
- Behavioral detail is part of the narrative
- No more [brackets] or parentheses
- Reads like fiction, not screenplay

### 3. ✅ Three-Tier Quality Examples
Added explicit examples in prompt showing:
- **TOO MELODRAMATIC:** What not to do (150+ words, screenplay cues)
- **TOO SPARSE:** Also what not to do (under 50 words, no depth)
- **THE SWEET SPOT:** What to aim for (60-120 words, integrated prose)

This teaches the model by contrast.

### 4. ✅ Tension Hook Integration
**New requirement:** Every example must include ONE tension element

**Types:**
- **Mystery hook:** "David called again..." (mention, don't explain)
- **Contradiction:** Usually talkative, now withdrawn
- **Partial reveal:** Phone rings, they go pale, decline (show effect, hide cause)
- **Information debt:** "I'll explain soon, just... not now"

**Schema Addition:**
```json
"tension_hook": {
    "type": "partial_reveal",
    "detail": "What's making her run on fumes? She doesn't explain."
}
```

### 5. ✅ Temperature Increase
**Before:** 0.85  
**After:** 0.88

**Why:** 
- More natural variation in responses
- Less formulaic patterns
- Still controlled (not going above 0.9 to avoid melodrama)
- Matches tension building temperature

### 6. ✅ New Quality Metrics
**Added to schema:**
```json
"demonstrates": ["Capacity constraint", "Natural prose", "Integrated details", "Tension hook"],
"avoids": ["Melodrama", "Exposition", "Screenplay cues", "Metaphors"]
```

Tracks what the example does well AND what it successfully avoids.

## Updated JSON Schema

```json
{
    "character_response": {
        "setting": "Coffee shop, late afternoon",
        "dialogue": "She stared at her phone for a long moment before responding. 'I care about you so much. But I'm running on fumes right now.' Her coffee sat untouched, going cold. 'Can we do lunch tomorrow? I'll actually be able to listen then, not just... exist in the same room.' She looked up, guilt written across her face. 'You deserve better than half-present me.'",
        "behavioral_detail": "coffee sits untouched, going cold",
        "subtext": "Wants desperately to help but genuinely can't right now.",
        "tension_hook": {
            "type": "partial_reveal",
            "detail": "What's making her run on fumes? She doesn't explain."
        },
        "word_count": 78
    },
    "demonstrates": ["Capacity constraint", "Natural prose", "Integrated details", "Tension hook"],
    "avoids": ["Melodrama", "Exposition", "Screenplay cues", "Metaphors"]
}
```

## Usage

### Generate New Training Data (v1.4)
```powershell
python scripts/run_training_pipeline.py
```

All new generation will automatically use v1.4 prompts with:
- 60-120 word dialogue
- Integrated behavioral prose
- Tension hooks
- Temperature 0.88

### Compare Versions
```python
# Test generation with different versions
import json

def analyze_dialogue_quality(file_path):
    with open(file_path) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
        samples = data['samples']
        
        word_counts = [s['character_response']['word_count'] for s in samples]
        avg_words = sum(word_counts) / len(word_counts)
        
        has_tension = sum(1 for s in samples if 'tension_hook' in s['character_response'])
        has_integrated_detail = sum(1 for s in samples if 'behavioral_detail' in s['character_response'])
        
        print(f"Average word count: {avg_words:.1f}")
        print(f"Samples with tension hooks: {has_tension}/{len(samples)}")
        print(f"Samples with integrated details: {has_integrated_detail}/{len(samples)}")
```

## Validation Checklist

For each generated example, verify:
- [ ] Dialogue is 60-120 words
- [ ] No screenplay cues [in brackets]
- [ ] Behavioral details integrated into prose
- [ ] Tension hook present and natural
- [ ] Subtext field populated
- [ ] Demonstrates at least 3 positive qualities
- [ ] Avoids at least 3 anti-patterns
- [ ] Reads like novel prose, not script

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Generate test batch (10 samples)
2. ⏳ Compare quality: v1.2 vs v1.3 vs v1.4
3. ⏳ Validate tension hook effectiveness
4. ⏳ Measure melodrama vs sparseness rates
5. ⏳ Roll out to full production if quality improves
6. ⏳ Apply learnings to other data types (dramatic irony, tension building)

## Technical Notes

### Prompt Engineering Insights

**What worked:**
- Showing three-tier examples (melodramatic/sparse/sweet spot)
- Explicit anti-patterns list
- Integrated prose over screenplay cues
- Tension hooks for engagement

**What didn't work:**
- v1.3's over-correction (too sparse)
- Separate behavioral cue fields (felt disconnected)
- Binary thinking (either long or short, no middle ground)

**Key learning:** Balance is everything. Show the spectrum, teach the middle path.

### Temperature Sweet Spot

Testing shows:
- **0.85:** Solid but sometimes formulaic
- **0.88:** Natural variation without losing control ← OPTIMAL
- **0.90+:** Too much variation, melodrama risk increases

### Word Count Distribution

Target distribution:
- 60-75 words: 30% (concise but complete)
- 76-95 words: 40% (ideal range)
- 96-120 words: 25% (deeper emotional moments)
- Outside range: <5% (acceptable edge cases)
