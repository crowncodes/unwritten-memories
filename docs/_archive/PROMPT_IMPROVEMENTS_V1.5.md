# Training Data Prompt Improvements v1.5 - NPC Response Framework Integration

## Summary

**v1.5 adds the critical NPC Response Framework** to training data generation, teaching the AI that **same action = different impact** based on urgency, personality, and relationship context.

This was missing from v1.4 and is essential for dynamic, context-aware responses.

## The Core Problem Solved

**Before v1.5:**
The prompt focused on dialogue quality but didn't teach the AI how context dramatically changes impact:
- Same action always had similar weight
- No urgency multipliers
- No relationship trust modifiers
- Missing the hierarchical response system

**After v1.5:**
AI learns that declining to help has wildly different impacts:
- Routine context (1x): "No worries! Maybe next time." (-0.42 impact)
- Crisis context (5x): "Oh. I... I really needed you." (-2.1 impact)

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Formula (Now Explicit in Prompts)

```
Impact = Base_Action 
         × Personality_Filter 
         × Urgency_Multiplier (1x-5x)
         × Trust_Modifier (0.8x-1.2x) 
         ÷ Capacity_Constraint
```

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Added NPC Response Framework Section

**New prompt section explains:**
- How same action creates different impacts
- Urgency multipliers (1x, 2x, 3x, 5x)
- Relationship trust modifiers
- The calculation formula

**Visual Example in Prompt:**
```
Example - Player declines to help:
• Routine context (1x): base -0.5 × 0.7 × 1x × 1.2 = -0.42 (Minor Harm)
  "No worries! Maybe next time."
  
• CRISIS context (5x): base -0.5 × 0.7 × 5x × 1.2 = -2.1 (Major Harm)  
  "Oh. I... I really needed you. I'll figure something out."
```

### 2. ✅ Urgency Level Guidance

**Added clear definitions:**
- **Routine (1x):** Casual hangout, no time pressure, low stakes
- **Important (2x):** Meaningful but not time-critical, moderate emotional stakes
- **Urgent (3x):** Time-sensitive, high emotional stakes, real consequences
- **Crisis (5x):** Emergency, life-altering, NOW or never, OVERRIDES personality

### 3. ✅ Relationship Trust Modifiers

**New guidance on trust effects:**
- **Low trust (0.0-0.3):** 0.8x modifier (amplifies harm, reduces benefit)
- **Neutral (0.4-0.6):** 1.0x modifier (no adjustment)
- **High trust (0.7-1.0):** 1.2x modifier (cushions harm, amplifies benefit)

### 4. ✅ Updated JSON Schema

**Situation object now includes:**
```json
"situation": {
    "support_needed": 7.0,
    "support_type": "emotional_processing",
    "urgency_level": "important",
    "urgency_multiplier": 2.0,
    "player_relationship_trust": 0.7,
    "description": "Friend dealing with breakup"
}
```

**Trust calculation now shows multipliers:**
```json
"trust_calculation": {
    "base_action": -0.15,
    "personality_mod": "Agreeableness 0.8 × 0.7 = softer",
    "urgency_multiplier": 2.0,
    "trust_modifier": 1.2,
    "honesty_bonus": 0.10,
    "formula": "(-0.15 × 0.7 × 2.0 × 1.2) + honesty +0.10 = -0.05",
    "tier": "VERY MINOR HARM (-0.1 to 0.0)",
    "narrative": "Important context (2x) but high trust cushions the blow"
}
```

### 5. ✅ Updated Critical Rules

**Rules now include:**
- Rule 2: Urgency AMPLIFIES impact - Crisis situations override personality patterns
- Rule 3: Relationship trust MODIFIES - High trust cushions, low trust amplifies harm

## Why This Matters

### For AI Training

**Before v1.5:**
```python
# AI learns: Declining help = always -0.5 impact
# Result: Static, predictable responses
```

**After v1.5:**
```python
# AI learns: Declining help varies by context
# - Casual coffee: -0.42 (minor)
# - Moving day crisis: -2.1 (major)
# Result: Dynamic, context-aware responses
```

### For Gameplay

**Player Experience:**
- Actions have weight appropriate to context
- Crisis moments feel genuinely high-stakes
- Personality still matters but urgency can override
- Trust history affects how NPCs interpret actions

**Example Scenario:**
Player declines to help low-Agreeableness NPC with routine task:
- Low A would normally be harsh (-0.7 base)
- But routine context (1x) keeps it mild (-0.7 overall)
- Response: "Whatever. I'll do it myself."

Same NPC in crisis:
- Low A harsh + crisis multiplier (5x) = -3.5 impact!
- Severely damages relationship
- Response: "I won't forget this. When you need me, don't call."

## Training Data Quality Impact

### What AI Will Learn

1. **Context Sensitivity**
   - Same action has different weight in different contexts
   - Crisis situations amplify everything
   - Personality can be overridden by urgency

2. **Relationship Dynamics**
   - Trust history changes interpretation
   - High trust gives benefit of doubt
   - Low trust assumes worst intentions

3. **Mathematical Consistency**
   - Shows exact calculation steps
   - Demonstrates multiplier effects
   - Provides narrative explanation of numbers

4. **Realistic Human Behavior**
   - People react differently under pressure
   - Context matters more than action
   - Relationships buffer negative actions

## Schema Comparison

### v1.4 Schema (Missing Context)
```json
"situation": {
    "support_needed": 7.0,
    "support_type": "emotional_processing",
    "urgency": "high",
    "description": "Friend needs help"
},
"outcomes": {
    "relationship_trust_change": -0.05,
    "trust_calculation": {
        "formula": "base -0.15 + honesty_bonus +0.10 = -0.05",
        "tier": "VERY MINOR HARM"
    }
}
```
**Problem:** No urgency multiplier, no trust modifier, formula incomplete

### v1.5 Schema (Complete Context)
```json
"situation": {
    "support_needed": 7.0,
    "support_type": "emotional_processing",
    "urgency_level": "important",
    "urgency_multiplier": 2.0,
    "player_relationship_trust": 0.7,
    "description": "Friend dealing with breakup"
},
"outcomes": {
    "relationship_trust_change": -0.05,
    "trust_calculation": {
        "base_action": -0.15,
        "personality_mod": "Agreeableness 0.8 × 0.7 = softer",
        "urgency_multiplier": 2.0,
        "trust_modifier": 1.2,
        "honesty_bonus": 0.10,
        "formula": "(-0.15 × 0.7 × 2.0 × 1.2) + honesty +0.10 = -0.05",
        "tier": "VERY MINOR HARM",
        "narrative": "Important context (2x) but high trust cushions blow"
    }
}
```
**Solution:** Full context, explicit multipliers, complete calculation

## Examples by Urgency Level

### Routine (1x) - Low Stakes
```json
"situation": {
    "urgency_level": "routine",
    "urgency_multiplier": 1.0,
    "description": "Casual coffee next week, flexible timing"
},
"character_response": {
    "dialogue": "No worries at all! Maybe next week instead? I'm pretty open."
},
"trust_calculation": {
    "base_action": -0.3,
    "urgency_multiplier": 1.0,
    "final_impact": -0.18
}
```

### Important (2x) - Moderate Stakes
```json
"situation": {
    "urgency_level": "important",
    "urgency_multiplier": 2.0,
    "description": "Help with job interview prep, meaningful but can reschedule"
},
"character_response": {
    "dialogue": "Oh. I was really counting on your help. Can we do Thursday instead?"
},
"trust_calculation": {
    "base_action": -0.4,
    "urgency_multiplier": 2.0,
    "final_impact": -0.56
}
```

### Urgent (3x) - High Stakes
```json
"situation": {
    "urgency_level": "urgent",
    "urgency_multiplier": 3.0,
    "description": "Major presentation tomorrow, needs feedback tonight"
},
"character_response": {
    "dialogue": "Wait, seriously? I need this tonight. I... okay. I'll figure something out."
},
"trust_calculation": {
    "base_action": -0.5,
    "urgency_multiplier": 3.0,
    "final_impact": -1.05
}
```

### Crisis (5x) - Life-Altering
```json
"situation": {
    "urgency_level": "crisis",
    "urgency_multiplier": 5.0,
    "description": "Emergency surgery, needs someone NOW, no other options"
},
"character_response": {
    "dialogue": "I... you're saying no? Right now? I have nobody else. I can't believe this."
},
"trust_calculation": {
    "base_action": -0.5,
    "urgency_multiplier": 5.0,
    "final_impact": -2.1,
    "tier": "MAJOR HARM",
    "recovery_time": "weeks to months"
}
```

## Integration with Game Systems

### AI Router Impact
```javascript
// Urgency affects AI routing decisions
function routeRequest(context) {
  const urgency = context.urgency_multiplier;
  
  if (urgency >= 5) {
    return "CLOUD";  // Crisis needs premium quality
  } else if (urgency >= 3) {
    return "HYBRID";  // Urgent uses both systems
  } else {
    return "LOCAL";  // Routine stays fast
  }
}
```

### Validation Impact
```javascript
// Validate urgency matches description
function validateUrgency(situation) {
  const description = situation.description.toLowerCase();
  const urgency = situation.urgency_multiplier;
  
  // Check for crisis keywords
  if (description.includes("emergency") && urgency < 5) {
    return { valid: false, reason: "Emergency should be crisis (5x)" };
  }
  
  // Check for routine keywords
  if (description.includes("casual") && urgency > 1) {
    return { valid: false, reason: "Casual should be routine (1x)" };
  }
  
  return { valid: true };
}
```

5. ⏳ Measure context awareness improvement
6. ⏳ Roll out to full production

## Version History

- **v1.2:** Original (melodramatic, 150-200 words)
- **v1.3:** Reduced to 50-100 words (too sparse)
- **v1.4:** Sweet spot 60-120 words, integrated prose, tension hooks
- **v1.5:** Added NPC Response Framework, urgency multipliers, trust modifiers ← **CURRENT**

## Credits

**v1.5 based on user insight:**
- "Is NPC Response Framework captured in training prompt?"
- Identified missing urgency multipliers
- Highlighted need for context-aware impact calculation
