# Unwritten: Complete Monetization & Content Strategy

## Monetization Philosophy

**Core Principle:** Full emotional core experience available free. Premium adds quality, breadth, and tools—never gates meaningful gameplay, endings, or relationships.

**No Pay-to-Win:**
- Cannot buy relationship levels
- Cannot buy legendary fusions
- Cannot skip emotional investment
- Cannot buy "better" endings
- Bonds must be earned

**Ethical Design:**
- No energy paywalls or timers
- No artificial wait times
- No loot boxes or gacha
- No dark patterns or FOMO mechanics
- Transparent pricing always

### Premium Value Proposition

**AI Quality Difference:**

```
FREE (Local AI):
"Sarah shared her bookshop plans. You discussed 
finances. She seemed grateful for your interest."
→ Functional, clear (7/10 quality)
→ 750ms generation time

PREMIUM (Cloud AI):
"Late afternoon at Café Luna. Sarah's notebook—
pages worn from touching, filled with sketches 
and dreams in her precise handwriting. She was 
nervous, fingers tracing margins. 'I've been 
working on these since 2 AM last Tuesday.' That 
vulnerability, that hope wrapped in fear—you'll 
remember this moment."
→ Emotionally rich, memorable (10/10 quality)
→ Instant (predictive pre-generation)
```

**Book Quality Difference:**

```
FREE SEASON BOOK (3-5k words):
- Chronological timeline
- Key moments summarized
- Player perspective only
- Functional prose

  her bookshop dream. You encouraged her."

PREMIUM SEASON NOVELLA (12-15k words):
- Three-act structure
- Fully dramatized scenes
- Multi-POV chapters (Sarah, Marcus, etc.)
- Literary prose with subtext
- Rich sensory immersion
- Example: Full 2-page scene of the moment, 
  with internal monologue, dialogue, tension, 
  and Sarah's perspective chapter showing 
  what she was thinking
```

```
$4.99/month = 2 lattes = 1 movie ticket
$49/year = $4.08/month (save $10/year)

Netflix:  $15.99/mo (passive entertainment)
Spotify:  $10.99/mo (passive music)
Unwritten: $4.99/mo (interactive, personal stories)

EXAMPLE (Premium Tier):
"Late afternoon at Café Luna. Sarah pulled out 
a worn notebook—pages filled with sketches, 
numbers, calculations. She was nervous showing 
it to you, fingers tracing the edges of pages 
she'd clearly touched a thousand times.

When you asked about the financial projections, 
she laughed this small, self-conscious laugh. 
'I've been working on these since 2 AM last 
Tuesday.'

The vulnerability in that admission—that she 
cares this much, works this hard on a dream 
she's scared won't happen—that's what you'll 
remember.

---

CHAPTER 2: Sarah's Perspective

Sarah wasn't going to show anyone the notebook. 
Ever. It was private. Sacred, almost. The pages 
held four years of secret hope, sketched in 
margins during slow shifts, calculated on 
sleepless nights when her grandmother's words 
echoed too loud to ignore.

'Do something brave.'

But you asked about books with actual curiosity, 
not that performative interest people fake at 
parties. You listened when she mentioned Murakami. 
You came back Tuesday. Same order, same table, 
different book each time.

Three months of Tuesdays built something.

So when you leaned forward and asked, 'What do 
you actually want to do?'—not as small talk, but 
like you genuinely wanted to know—she felt her 
hand move to her bag.

The notebook. Her secret.

'Can I show you something?'"

## AI Tier System (Local vs Cloud)

### The Hybrid AI Model

Unwritten uses **two AI systems** to balance quality and cost:

---

### FREE TIER: Local AI (On-Device)

**Technology:**
- **Model:** Phi-3-mini or equivalent (small language model)
- **Size:** ~2GB on device
- **Processing:** On-device inference
- **Speed:** 750ms average per generation

**How It Works:**

```javascript
// LOCAL AI DECOMPOSED PROMPT CHAIN

STEP 1: Analyze Interaction (150ms)
Prompt: "What happened in this interaction?
         Player choice: Encouraged Sarah's dream
         Activity: Coffee conversation
         Answer: [What, Positive/Negative, Significance 1-5]"
→ "Coffee date. Encouraged dream. Positive. Significance: 4"

STEP 2: Personality Impact (180ms)
Prompt: "Event: Encouraged Sarah's dream
         Character: Openness 4.3, Neuroticism 3.9
         Which trait changes? Format: trait+amount"
→ "openness+0.2, neuroticism-0.1"

STEP 3: Generate Memory (200ms)
Prompt: "Event: Encouraged Sarah's dream
         Complete this memory (20-40 words):
         'During coffee, Sarah mentioned...'"
→ "During coffee, Sarah mentioned her bookshop 
    plans. You encouraged her to pursue it. She 
    seemed grateful and more confident."

STEP 4: Update Description (220ms)
Prompt: "Old: 'Sarah is a barista with dreams.'
         New info: [memory from step 3]
         Add naturally. Keep under 100 words."
→ Updated description with new detail

TOTAL TIME: 750ms
QUALITY: 7/10 (functional, clear, good)
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Zero ongoing cost
- ✅ Privacy (on-device)
- ✅ Fast enough for gameplay
- ✅ Functional quality

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Less poetic/literary
- ❌ Simpler vocabulary
- ❌ Less emotional nuance
- ❌ Template-guided (less variety)
- ❌ Can't do multi-POV well

**Use Cases:**
- Card evolution (Level 1-3)
- Memory generation
- Dialogue snippets
- Routine content
- Free season books (3-5k words)

---

### PREMIUM TIER: Cloud AI (GPT-4 Level)

**Technology:**
- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4 or GPT-4 level
- **Processing:** Cloud-based
- **Speed:** Instant (predictive pre-generation)

**How It Works:**

```javascript
// CLOUD AI FULL-CONTEXT GENERATION

Single comprehensive prompt:
"Generate character evolution for Sarah Anderson.
 
 Context: 
 - Player encouraged her bookshop dream
 - Week 28 of relationship
 - Level 3 → Level 4 evolution
 - Player personality: [full profile]
 - Emotional state: INSPIRED
 - Life direction: Seek Deep Relationships
 - Previous memories: [full history]
 
 Generate:
 - Memory (50-100 words, rich detail, sensory)
 - Personality shift (justified, nuanced)
 - Updated description (literary quality)
 - Unlocks (contextually appropriate)
 - Sarah's internal POV (what she was thinking)
 
 Style: Literary, emotionally authentic, 
        show don't tell, rich subtext"

→ Exceptional quality output (10/10)
→ Generated in 3 seconds
→ But FEELS instant (predictive caching)
```

**Predictive Pre-Generation:**
```javascript
// Premium users: AI predicts 5 steps ahead

After player does X:
  AI pre-generates outcomes for:
  ├─ Likely choice A (70% probability)
  ├─ Likely choice B (20% probability)
  ├─ Likely choice C (8% probability)
  ├─ Edge choice D (1.5% probability)
  └─ Edge choice E (0.5% probability)

Result: 95%+ of player choices are instant
        Only 5% require on-demand generation
        Which STILL feels fast (3 seconds)
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Literary-quality prose
- ✅ Rich emotional depth
- ✅ Nuanced characterization
- ✅ Multi-POV capability
- ✅ Subtext and layers
- ✅ Excellent books (12-15k words)
- ✅ Feels instant to user

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Requires internet
- ❌ Costs per generation (~$0.02-0.05)
- ❌ No privacy (cloud processing)

**Use Cases:**
- Premium card evolution (all levels)
- Premium memory generation
- Multi-POV chapters
- Premium season novellas (12-15k)
- Lifetime novels (80-150k)
- Character internal monologues

### Quality Comparison Example

**SAME MOMENT - Different AI Tiers:**

**Scenario:** Sarah shares her bookshop dream (Level 2→3 evolution)

**LOCAL AI (Free):**
```
Memory Generated (750ms):
"During coffee, Sarah showed you her business 
plan notebook. You asked about the financial 
projections, and she admitted she's been working 
on them for months. It felt like she was letting 
you into something important."

Description Update:
"Sarah is a barista at Café Luna with a dream 
of opening an independent bookshop. She's been 
quietly planning for years, and recently shared 
her detailed business plan with you. She values 
careful preparation and seems to trust you with 
her ambitions."

Quality: 7/10 - Functional ✓
            Consistent ✓

**CLOUD AI (Premium):**
```
Memory Generated (instant):
"Late afternoon at Café Luna. Sarah pulled out 
a worn notebook—pages filled with sketches, 
numbers, calculations she'd touched a thousand 
times. Nervous fingers traced margins while she 
explained the inventory costs, the lease 
projections, the dream measured in precise 
dollars and careful timelines.

'I've been working on these since 2 AM last 
Tuesday,' she said, this small self-conscious 
laugh escaping.

The vulnerability in that admission—that she 
cares this much, works this hard on something 
she's terrified won't happen—that's what stays 
with you. Not the numbers. The hope wrapped in 
fear."

Description Update:
"Sarah is a barista at Café Luna, but 'barista' 
isn't who she is—it's what pays rent while she 
plans her real dream: an independent bookshop 
on a quiet street where people linger. She's 
shown you the notebook where she's mapped every 
detail, from shelving layouts to opening-day 
playlists. Behind her quiet exterior is someone 
who prepares relentlessly for the things that 
terrify her. She's starting to trust you with 
the parts of herself she usually keeps hidden."

Sarah's Internal POV (Premium exclusive):
"Why am I showing him this? I've never told 
anyone about the bookshop. My parents would call 
it impractical. My ex said I was 'cute' when I 
mentioned it, like it was a phase. But when he 
leaned forward and asked about the numbers—
really asked, not just to be polite—something 
in me cracked open. Maybe he gets it. Maybe 
someone finally sees this as real."

Quality: 10/10 - Functional ✓

## Ethical Safeguards

### What We Will NEVER Do

❌ **Energy Paywalls**
- No "wait 4 hours to continue"
- No "buy energy to keep playing"
- Play as much as you want, always
- Energy is in-game resource, not monetization lever

❌ **Relationship Buying**
- Cannot buy relationship levels
- Cannot skip emotional investment
- Bonds must be earned through play
- Premium gives better writing, not faster bonds

❌ **Story Gating**
