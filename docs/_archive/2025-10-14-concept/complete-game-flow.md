# Complete Game Flow: Character Creation to Multi-Lifetime Play

## Overview

Unwritten supports playthroughs ranging from **20 weeks to 3000+ weeks** (a character's entire lifetime, ~57 years). This requires sophisticated systems for character creation, goal evolution, season transitions, and context management to ensure consistency across decades of simulated life.

---

## 1. Character Creation System

### Philosophy
Start specific enough to feel real, but open enough to discover who you become. The character creation process establishes your **starting point**, not your destination.

### The Creation Flow

```

- Planning vs spontaneity (conscientiousness)
- Conflict handling (agreeableness)
- Stress response (neuroticism)

  // MINOR available to everyone, but filtered by:

## 6. Multi-Lifetime Continuity System (3000+ Weeks)

### The Challenge

A playthrough spanning 3000 weeks (57 years) requires:
- **Context management** (can't keep everything in memory)
- **Consistency tracking** (avoid contradictions)
- **Identity evolution** (character changes over decades)
- **Narrative coherence** (life story makes sense)

### Solution: Hierarchical Context System

```javascript
const CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT = {
  
  // TIER 1: Always Active (Current Context)
  current_active: {
    size: "Last 12 weeks detailed",
    contains: [
      "Current season goals",
      "Active arcs (all details)",
      "Recent card plays (every card)",
      "Current relationships (full state)",
      "Current meters and resources",
      "Obligations and routines",
      "Pending decisions"
    ],
    memory_impact: "~2MB",
    generation_context: "Full detail for AI"
  },
  
  // TIER 2: Recent Memory (Rolling Window)
  recent_memory: {
    size: "Last 50 weeks summarized",
    contains: [
      "Completed seasons (summary)",
      "Major decisions made",
      "Key crises and outcomes",
      "Relationship milestones",
      "Significant achievements",
      "Identity shifts"
    ],
    memory_impact: "~5MB",
    generation_context: "Reference for callbacks and consistency"
  },
  
  // TIER 3: Life Story (Compressed)
  life_story: {
    size: "Entire playthrough compressed",
    contains: [
      "Phase transitions",
      "Defining moments only",
      "Major relationships (key events)",
      "Identity evolution timeline",
      "Critical decisions",
      "Life direction changes",
      "Crisis points"
    ],
    memory_impact: "~10MB for 3000 weeks",
    compression_ratio: "50:1",
    generation_context: "Foundational truths, establish history"
  },
  
  // TIER 4: Character State (Permanent)
  character_state: {
    size: "Current snapshot + history",
    contains: [
      "Current personality (evolved)",
      "All skills (current levels)",
      "All relationships (current)",
      "Identity tags (accumulated)",
      "Phase and age",
      "Resources and status",
      "Permanent consequences"
    ],
    memory_impact: "~1MB",
