**We have ~34k tokens remaining.**

Would you like me to:
1. **Create Documents #4 & #5** (Scenarios & Achievements)?
2. **Summarize key takeaways** from all three documents?
3. **Deep dive** on a specific technical challenge you're most concerned about?
4. **Create an implementation roadmap** showing how to build this in phases?

What would be most valuable to you?
