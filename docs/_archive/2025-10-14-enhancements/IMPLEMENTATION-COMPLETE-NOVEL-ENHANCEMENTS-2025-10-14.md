## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Hook Points (Recommendation #1)
- Systematic tension every 2-3 weeks
- 5 hook types (mystery, revelation, opportunity, relationship shift, pressure)
- Placement rules (between major beats, avoid decision weeks)
- Max 3 active hooks (prevents scattered feeling)

### 2. Ticking Clock (Recommendation #2)
- In-world deadlines only (wedding season, lease expiring, savings running out)
- No real-time pressure (master_truths compliant)
- Integration with aspirations, relationships, health crises, opportunities
- Display rules (no FOMO copy)

### 3. Information Debt / Mystery Threads (Recommendation #3)
- 2-3 active mysteries maximum
- Plant → Develop (3-5 week clues) → Reveal (aligned with arc)
- 3 mystery types: character secrets, hidden motivations, upcoming reveals
- All must connect to main aspiration or major relationship

### 4. Stakes Escalation (Recommendation #4)
- Consequence chains across multiple life areas
- Health neglect → career + relationship + aspiration damage
- Financial crisis → housing + relationships + aspiration + health
- Dramatic moments, not stat penalties
- Foreshadowed (2-4 week warnings)

### 5. Dramatic Irony (Recommendation #5)
- NPC perspective cards (1-2 per NPC per season)
- Secret information reveals (player knows what character doesn't)
- Strategic timing (mid Act II, before revelations)
- Creates empathy and anticipation

### 6. Foreshadowing (Recommendation #6)
- Enhanced crisis foreshadowing (health, relationship, financial, career)
- 2-4 week warning cards before major events
- Escalating symptoms (mirror → coffee → shaking hands → collapse)
- Makes crises feel earned, not arbitrary

### 7. Character Contradictions (Recommendation #7)
- 1-2 contradiction moments per NPC per season
- 4 types: cautious_becomes_bold, supportive_becomes_confrontational, reserved_becomes_vulnerable, optimistic_shows_darkness
- Must be earned (relationship level 3+, trust 0.6+)
- Makes NPCs less predictable, more human

### 8. Micro-Cliffhangers (Recommendation #8)
- Day-end hooks (20% of days)
- Week-end hooks (40% of weeks)
- Turn-end hooks (10% of turns - very selective)
- Small curiosity nudges, not anxiety-inducing
- Quick resolution (hours to days in-game)

### 9. Neglect Punishment (Recommendation #9)
- Dramatic story-worthy consequences
- Health: Public collapse during important moment
- Relationships: NPC makes major life decision without you (moves away, gets engaged)
- Career: Blamed for team failure, reputation damaged
- Aspiration: Watch others succeed at what you wanted

### 10. Emotional Echoes (Recommendation #10)
- Past high-emotion moments (weight 7+) resurface during similar situations
- 4 trigger contexts: stress, success, choice, relationship moment
- Multi-season persistence (Season 2 echoes in Season 5)
- Pattern tracking (learn from past or repeat mistakes)
- Regret system (past regrets inform future choices)
