---

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. ✅ Prompt Engineering Principles (`32-prompt-engineering-principles.md`)

**Added: Principle 6 - Emotional Capacity Realism**

- **Core Insight:** Characters at 2.5/10 emotional capacity cannot provide 8/10 level emotional support
- **Capacity Factors:** Stress, sleep deprivation, trauma, active problems, exhaustion
- **Realistic Limitations:** Detailed examples for capacity levels 0-10
- **Authenticity Framework:** Decision tree for constraining responses to capacity
- **Circumstance Stacking:** Multiple stressors compound to reduce capacity

**Key Innovation:** This principle prevents unrealistic "perfect friend" responses and creates authentic human limitations.

---

### 2. ✅ Prompt Templates Library (`33-prompt-templates-library.md`)

**Added: Template 11 - Dramatic Irony Card Generation**

- **Purpose:** Create "yelling at TV screen" tension through knowledge gaps
- **Three Option Types:**
  1. Tone-Deaf Option (character acts on incomplete information)
  2. Well-Intentioned but Misguided (tries to help incorrectly)
  3. Growth Choice (acknowledges limitations authentically)
- **Capacity Constraints:** Different options available based on emotional capacity
- **Player Overlays:** UI text reminding player of irony

**Added: Tension Injection Requirements (ALL evolution templates)**

- **4 Tension Types:**
  1. Mystery Hooks (unanswered questions)
  2. Partial Reveals (show effect without cause)
  3. Contradiction Moments (character acts against pattern)
  4. Stakes Escalation (consequences for inaction)
- **Frequency Guidelines:** 1 in 3 for Level 1-2, 1 in 2 for Level 3-4
- **Tension Metadata:** Tracking system for hooks and payoffs
- **Memory Integration:** Special memory types for tension hooks

**Key Innovation:** Every 2-3 evolutions plants narrative hooks, creating "one more week" engagement.

---

### 3. ✅ Context & Memory Systems (`34-context-memory-systems.md`)

**Updated:** Seven-Layer Context Model (was six)

**Added: Layer 6 - Dramatic Irony Context**

- **Knowledge Gap Tracking:**
  - What player knows that character doesn't
  - What character knows that player doesn't
  - Tension opportunity assessment
- **Capacity Limitations:** How emotional capacity affects perception
- **Irony Type Recommendations:** Automatic selection of appropriate dramatic irony approach

**Enhanced: Memory Recall with Emotional Resonance**

- **5 Resonance Factors:**
  1. Same emotion, different context (0.8 weight)
  2. Opposite emotion, growth opportunity (0.9 weight)
  3. Past trauma, current trigger (0.95 weight)
  4. Past joy, current sadness (0.85 weight)
  5. Emotional growth callback (0.7 weight)
- **Situational Overlap Detection:** Identifies when memories emotionally resonate with current context

**Key Innovation:** Memories are recalled based on emotional impact, not just recency, creating powerful callbacks.

### 4. ✅ Consistency & Coherence Validation (`35-consistency-coherence.md`)

**Added: Check 6 - NovelQualityValidator**

**Four Quality Checks:**

1. **Emotional Authenticity (35% weight)**
   - Validates capacity constraints
   - Detects when character exceeds limitations
   - Awards bonuses for authentic struggle and self-awareness

2. **Tension Building (30% weight)**
   - Checks for mystery hooks, partial reveals, contradictions, stakes escalation
   - Validates information debt
   - Ensures "one more week" engagement

3. **Dramatic Irony (15% weight, when applicable)**
   - Validates knowledge gap utilization
   - Checks for player overlay text
   - Ensures capacity-constrained misreads

4. **Hook Effectiveness (20% weight)**
   - Validates follow-up hooks
   - Checks for unanswered questions
   - Assesses time pressure elements
   - Estimates player curiosity (low/medium/high/very_high)

**Enhanced ValidationPipeline:**
- Added `novel_quality` to validation checks (20% weight)
- Rebalanced weights to prioritize novel-quality and authenticity
- Integrated with existing validators

**Key Innovation:** Automated quality validation ensures every generation meets literary fiction standards.

### 5. ✅ Local Model Training (`36-local-model-training.md`)

**Added: Emotional Authenticity Training Data**

```python
generate_emotional_authenticity_data(target_count=5000)
```

- **Purpose:** Train model to understand capacity limitations
- **Critical Rules:**
  - Low capacity (1-4) CANNOT provide full support
  - Medium capacity (5-7) can provide moderate support
  - Only high capacity (8-10) can provide full support
- **Response Types:** Try but fail, withdraw, offer practical help, acknowledge limitations

**Added: Tension Building Training Data**

```python
generate_tension_building_data(target_count=3000)
```

- **Purpose:** Train model to create page-turner moments
- **5 Techniques:** Mystery hooks, partial reveals, contradictions, information debt, foreshadowing
- **Payoff Timelines:** 2-4 weeks, 5-8 weeks, season_end

**Enhanced: MultiTaskLoRAModel Architecture**

**4 New Task Heads:**
1. `emotional_capacity_head` - Predicts character's emotional capacity (0-10)
2. `tension_potential_head` - Assesses tension potential (0-1)
3. `authenticity_head` - Scores response authenticity (0-1)
4. `hook_value_head` - Rates page-turner engagement (0-1)

**Updated:**
- Forward method supports 8 tasks (was 4)
- LoRA parameters include all new heads
- Total training data: 31K examples (was 23K)
- Cost estimate: $45-55 (was $30-40)

**Key Innovation:** On-device model can now validate emotional authenticity and tension without cloud API.

## What Makes This "Novel-Quality"

### Traditional Game Dialogue:
```
"I'll help you with that!"
"Don't worry, we'll figure it out."
"You can count on me."
```

### Novel-Quality Dialogue (with enhancements):
```
"I want to help, I really do. But honestly? I'm so exhausted right now 
I can barely think straight. Can we... can we talk about this tomorrow? 
When I'm not running on fumes? You deserve better than half-attention."
```

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Constrained by capacity (2.5/10 - exhausted)
- ✅ Shows genuine desire to help (they care)
- ✅ Acknowledges limitation honestly
- ✅ Offers alternative (tomorrow)
- ✅ Respects friend's needs (you deserve better)
- ✅ FEELS AUTHENTIC
