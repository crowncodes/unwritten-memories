**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Updated File:** `docs/2.gameplay/37-dramatic-irony-system.md`  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Enhancement Summary

Enhanced the dramatic irony system with six major new mechanics that create deeper emotional engagement, realistic tension, and personality-driven consequences.

---

## New Systems Added

### 1. **Character Obliviousness & Tension**
**What:** Dialogue options that showcase character's ignorance when player knows the truth

**Example:** 
- Player knows Sarah is grieving David (dead fiancé)
- Character doesn't know why Sarah is sad
- Dialogue options reveal character's cluelessness
- Player feels "yelling at the TV screen" tension

**Key Features:**
- Player overlay text: "(You know this is tone-deaf, but your character doesn't...)"
- Multiple dialogue options showing different levels of ignorance
- NPCs react realistically to character's misunderstandings
- Relationship impacts based on how badly character misses the mark

### 2. **Memory-Based Callback System**
**What:** Player can remember dramatic irony moments and act on them in future

**Example:**
- Week 14: Learn David's birthday (August 14) through POV card
- Week 66: One year later, get morning reminder
- Choice: Remember and send thoughtful message (+0.3 relationship, +0.4 trust)
- Or: Forget and feel quiet regret (no punishment, natural consequence)

**Key Features:**
- Callbacks can span seasons (one year later)
- High conscientiousness characters more likely to remember
- Meaningful actions unlock based on memory
- Powerful emotional moments when character remembers

### 3. **Trait-Based Discovery Consequences**
**What:** OCEAN personality determines whether discovering truth helps or harms

**Healthy Profile (Low Neuroticism + High Agreeableness):**
- Partner has secret meeting → "Probably planning something nice"
- Waits patiently → Surprise succeeds
- Trust validated, relationship strengthens

**Toxic Profile (High Neuroticism + Low Agreeableness):**
- Partner has secret meeting → "They're cheating on me"
- Confronts or stalks → Ruins surprise
- Relationship damaged, carries guilt

**Key Features:**
- Same information, completely different outcomes
- Jealousy, anxiety, insecurity based on traits
- Self-awareness option: Feel bad impulse, choose not to act on it
- Personal growth opportunities

### 4. **Emotional State Modifiers**
**What:** Current mood affects dialogue quality and available responses

**Good Emotional State (Physical >= 7, Emotional >= 7):**
- Empathetic options unlocked
- Patient, supportive responses available
- Can be there for others

**Poor Emotional State (Physical < 4, Emotional < 4):**
- Empathetic options LOCKED
- Only self-centered responses available
- Realistic limitation: Too drained to support others

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic dialogue availability based on current state
- Natural consequences of burnout
- Realistic human limitations

### 5. **Real Consequences Persist**
**What:** Bad choices aren't forgotten—relationships remember

**Examples:**
- Jealous outburst → Trust broken (-0.6) → Sarah guarded for weeks/months
- Toxic response → Slow relationship decay (-0.05 per week)
- Pattern of behavior → NPC may end relationship
- Internal guilt → Affects future interactions even if hidden

**Key Features:**
- Long-term relationship impacts
- NPCs have memory and react accordingly
- Secret violations player carries internally
- Relationship decay for festering resentment

### 6. **OCEAN Trait Integration Matrix**
**What:** Complete personality response system

**Openness:** High = flexible interpretation, Low = rigid thinking  
**Conscientiousness:** High = remembers details, Low = impulsive  
**Extraversion:** High = wants to discuss, Low = processes internally  
**Agreeableness:** High = assumes best, Low = suspicious  
**Neuroticism:** High = anxious/worst-case, Low = calm/trusting

## Design Principles

### 1. Tension Through Obliviousness
```
Player knows → Character doesn't → Dialogue reveals ignorance → Player feels tension
```

### 2. Memory Rewards Attention
```
Dramatic irony moment → Player remembers → Future callback → Meaningful action
```

### 3. Personality Determines Outcome
```
Same secret + Different traits = Completely different consequences
```

### 4. Discovery Can Harm
```
Knowledge ≠ Always good
Some personalities + Some secrets = Toxic outcomes
```

### 5. Emotional State Gates Empathy
```
Poor emotional state → Locked empathetic options → Only selfish choices
```

### 6. Real Consequences Persist
```
Bad choice → Not forgotten → Relationships remember → Future affected
```

### 7. Growth Through Struggle
```
Negative impulse → Self-awareness → Choose better path → Character growth
```

## Example Scenarios Added

### Scenario: Sarah's Grief (High Conscientiousness)
1. Week 14: Learn David died, birthday is August 14
2. Week 66: Morning reminder—"It's August 14th again"
3. Action: Take Sarah to David's favorite waterfront café
4. Result: Sarah opens up, tells stories, begins healing
5. Impact: +0.5 relationship, +0.6 trust, major emotional milestone

### Scenario: Partner's Secret (High Neuroticism)
1. Overhear partner planning secret meeting with "Jamie"
2. Anxiety spirals: "Are they cheating?"
3. Options:
   - Confront (ruins surprise, -0.3 relationship)
   - Stalk (violates trust, internal guilt)
   - Choose trust (growth opportunity)
4. Reality: Partner was planning nice surprise for you
5. Consequence: Depends on choice made

### Scenario: Jealousy Risk (Toxic Traits)
1. Discover Sarah loved David deeply, still does
2. High Neuroticism + Low Agreeableness triggers jealousy
3. Options:
   - "Do you love him more than anyone?" (damages relationship -0.4)
   - "Where do I stand compared to him?" (may end friendship -0.6)
   - Stay silent but fester (slow decay -0.05/week)
   - Recognize jealousy, choose compassion (growth +0.1)
