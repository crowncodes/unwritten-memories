## Active Documents (Not Archived)

These documents remain in the main `docs/` folder:

- **CANONICAL-DECISIONS-LOG.md** - Active tracking of all canonical decisions (DO NOT ARCHIVE)
- **MASTER-TRUTHS-V1.2-CHANGES-SUMMARY.md** - Useful changelog reference

- **master_truths_canonical_spec_v_1_2.md** - Current canonical specification

## Why Archive?

These summaries served their purpose:
1. ✅ Tracked work during implementation
2. ✅ Documented decisions and rationale
3. ✅ Ensured nothing was lost during enhancement
4. ✅ Provided detailed specifications for integration

Now that all work is integrated, keeping them in the main `docs/` folder creates clutter. They remain in the archive for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding decision rationale
- Audit trails
- Future retrospectives

**Archive Status:** Complete and organized  
**Next Cleanup:** Review and archive summaries from future enhancement cycles
