# Documentation Update Summary - October 13, 2025

## Overview

**Purpose:** Resolve contradictions between master_truths and concept documentation, establish canonical specifications for season length and relationship progression.

**Version:** master_truths v1.0 → v1.1

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Season Length System (RESOLVED)

**Previous State:**
- master_truths: "12 weeks default, 24/36 extended"
- 1.concept/15: "12-100 weeks variable based on complexity"
- ❌ **CONTRADICTION**

**New Canonical Spec:**
- **Fixed player-choice season lengths: 12, 24, or 36 weeks**
- **Standard (12w):** Focused single-goal arc, 2-3 complications
- **Extended (24w):** Complex multi-path arc, 4-6 complications
- **Epic (36w):** Transformational saga, 6-10 complications
- Players choose length at season start based on aspiration
- Can end season early if goal completes ahead of schedule

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ master_truths v1.0 → v1.1 (section 2, section 15)
- ✅ 1.concept/15-progression-phases.md (complete rewrite of season length section)
- ✅ CANONICAL-DECISIONS-LOG.md (Decision #001)

**Rationale:**
- Fixed lengths easier to balance and test
- Clear player time commitment
- Simpler memory architecture
- Flexibility through player choice + content density

---

### 2. Relationship Level System (RESOLVED)

**Previous State:**
- master_truths: "Levels 0-5" (unclear what Level 0 represents)
- 1.concept/13: Started at "Level 1: Stranger" (implied 5 levels, not 6)
- ❌ **CONTRADICTION**

**New Canonical Spec:**
- **Six levels (0-5) where Level 0 = "Not Met"**
- Level 0: Not Met (never interacted)
- Level 1: Stranger (0-5 interactions, Trust 0.0-0.2)
- Level 2: Acquaintance (6-15 interactions, Trust 0.2-0.4)
- Level 3: Friend (16-30 interactions, Trust 0.4-0.6)
- Level 4: Close Friend (31-75 interactions, Trust 0.6-0.8)
- Level 5: Soulmate/Best Friend (76+ interactions, Trust 0.8-1.0)
- **Level-up requires BOTH interaction count AND trust threshold**

**Display Rules:**
- UI shows: "Level 3 (Trust 0.52)"
- Never show "Level 0" (display "Not Met" instead)
- Archives track Level 0 internally

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ master_truths v1.0 → v1.1 (section 2, section 15)
- ✅ 1.concept/13-ai-personality-system.md (added Level 0, detailed all 6 levels)
- ✅ 1.concept/11-card-system-basics.md (clarified 0-5 display)
- ✅ CANONICAL-DECISIONS-LOG.md (Decision #002)

**Rationale:**
- Level 0 useful for "never met" NPCs
- Enables first-meeting special mechanics
- Cleaner database (NULL vs. 0 vs. 1)
- More progression granularity

### 3. Turn Structure (CONFIRMED - NO CHANGES)

**Status:** ✅ **ALIGNED** across all docs
- 3 turns per day (Morning / Afternoon / Evening)
- 7 days per week
- No updates needed

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Documentation Hierarchy Established

```
master_truths v1.1 (AUTHORITY - Single Source of Truth)
        ↓ compliance required ↓
    1.concept/                  2.gameplay/
    (WHY & WHAT)               (HOW & EXACT)
    Design Philosophy          Implementation Specs
    Player Experience          Formulas & Catalogs
```

### 2. Fixed Season Lengths with Player Choice

Players get narrative flexibility through:
- Choosing appropriate length for their story (12/24/36 weeks)
- Content density adjusting to length (more complications in longer seasons)
- Early completion option (can end when goal achieved)
- Abandonment option (can pivot if goal becomes impossible)

### 3. Six-Level Relationship System

Clearer progression with explicit requirements:
- Level 0 = "Not Met" (never interacted, tracked internally)
- Levels 1-5 displayed with descriptive names
- Both interactions AND trust required to level up
- Prevents grinding without genuine connection

### 4. Change Control Process

All future changes must:
1. Follow change proposal template
2. Be logged in CANONICAL-DECISIONS-LOG.md
3. Update master_truths with versioning
4. Get sign-off (Product + Narrative + Systems)
5. Update all affected downstream docs
6. Include migration notes

---

## Impact Analysis

### Breaking Changes
**None** - v1.1 clarifies v1.0 intent without changing core systems.

### Migration Notes
- Docs referencing "variable 12-100 week seasons" → Update to "player-choice 12/24/36 weeks"
- Docs starting relationships at "Level 1" → Add "Level 0 (Not Met)" state
- All relationship references → Include interaction count + trust requirements

### Implementation Impact
- Season selection UI needs three options (12/24/36 weeks)
- Early completion detection system needed
- Relationship level 0 state in database
- First meeting special mechanics enabled
- Level-up formula: `if (interactions >= threshold && trust >= threshold) { levelUp(); }`

---

## Next Actions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Review remaining 1.concept/ docs for compliance
2. Update any lingering season length or relationship references
3. Begin 2.gameplay/ reorganization planning

### Short-Term (This Month)
1. Complete 2.gameplay/ reorganization
2. Create all implementation spec files
3. Ensure full master_truths v1.1 compliance

### Long-Term (Ongoing)
1. Maintain CANONICAL-DECISIONS-LOG.md
2. Review master_truths quarterly
3. Track compliance as new docs added
