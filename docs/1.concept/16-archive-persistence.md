# Unwritten: Archive & Persistence System

## The Archive Philosophy

When a **season** ends, that chapter of your life becomes a **memory**. When your character's **lifetime** ends, all seasons become a complete **life story**. This creates the emotional core: attachment → completion → nostalgia → motivation to continue or start fresh.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Seasons are Chapters, Lifetimes are Books**

```
SEASON = One complete story arc (12, 24, or 36 weeks - player choice)
├─ Act I: Setup
├─ Act II: Conflict
└─ Act III: Resolution
→ Generates ONE "book" (short story / novella)

Standard (12w): Focused single goal
Extended (24w): Complex multi-path story
Epic (36w): Transformational saga

LIFETIME = Character's full story (8-10 seasons, 200-360 weeks typical)
├─ Season 1: "Finding My Footing" (12 weeks)
├─ Season 2: "The Photography Dream" (24 weeks)
├─ Season 3: "Sarah's Bookshop" (36 weeks)
├─ ... (up to Season 8, or 10 with premium)
└─ Final Season: Season 8-10 (season limit or player choice)
→ Generates LIFE BOOKSHELF (8-10 novels, 120k-150k words total)
```

### 2. **Two Archive Levels**

**SEASON ARCHIVES (Per-Season)**
- Created automatically at end of every season
- Preserves that chapter's story
- Can be reopened/read anytime
- Unlocks even if you continue

**LIFETIME ARCHIVES (Per-Character)**
- Created when character reaches season limit (8-10) or player chooses to retire
- Character's complete Life Bookshelf of novels (one per season)
- Character becomes "retired" (archived, view-only)
- Full retrospective view across all seasons
- Total: 120k-150k words (novel trilogy equivalent)

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Architecture

```javascript
const CHARACTER_ARCHIVE = {
  character_id: "uuid",
  name: "Alex Chen",
  created_at: "2025-10-13",
  status: "active" | "complete",
  
  // LIFETIME STATS
  total_seasons: 7,
  total_weeks: 224,
  age_start: 28,
  age_current: 47,
  
  // SEASON ARCHIVES
  seasons: [
    {
      season_id: "s1_uuid",
      season_number: 1,
      title: "Finding My Footing",
      weeks: 18,
      age_range: [28, 28],
      status: "complete",
      outcome: "success",
      
      // Season-specific data
      evolved_cards: [...],
      story_log: [...],

    },
    // ... more seasons
  ],
  
  // CURRENT STATE (if active)
  current_state: {
    season_number: 8,
    week: 15,

  },
  
  // LIFETIME DATA (if complete)
  lifetime_data: {

    lifetime_novel_url: null
  }
};
```

## Design Principles

### 1. **Season Autonomy**
Each season is a complete, satisfying story arc that can stand alone.

### 2. **Continuity Across Seasons**
But seasons build on each other—consequences persist, relationships evolve.

### 3. **Flexible Endpoints**
Players can end after any season OR continue indefinitely.

### 4. **Scalable Book Generation**
- 1 season = 1 short story
- 3 seasons = 1 novella
- 7+ seasons = 1 novel or multi-volume series

### 5. **No Forced Endings**
The game never forces you to end. You choose when the story is complete.

---

## Player Experience Goals

**Players should feel:**
- ✅ Each season is a complete chapter
- ✅ Free to continue or end at any time
- ✅ Previous seasons remain accessible
- ✅ Books capture their unique story
- ✅ Multi-season stories have continuity

**Players should never feel:**
- ❌ Forced to end prematurely
- ❌ Previous seasons are lost
- ❌ Unclear about what carries forward
- ❌ Books don't reflect their choices
- ❌ Archives are disconnected fragments

---

## NEW: Emotional Echoes System

### Memories That Resurface

**Philosophy:** Your character remembers. Past emotional experiences inform current moments, creating continuity that feels like a real life being lived.

**Implementation:** High-emotion moments (weight 7+) are automatically tagged and can resurface during similar current situations.

```javascript
const EMOTIONAL_ECHO_INTEGRATION = {
  memory_tagging: {
    automatic: "System tags high-emotion moments (decisive decisions, crises, successes, relationship milestones)",
    weight_threshold: "Memories with emotional weight 7+ eligible for echoes",
    context_tags: "Emotion type, situation type, NPCs involved, season/week"
  },
  
  echo_triggers: {
    during_stress: "Recall past similar stress and how you handled it",
    during_success: "Remember who believed in you when no one else did",
    during_choice: "Past similar decisions and their outcomes inform current choice",
    during_relationship_moment: "Recall formative moments with that person"
  },
  
  multi_season_echoes: {
    season_2_can_echo_in_season_5: true,
    time_references: "System generates appropriate time references ('2 years ago', 'Last season')",
    continuity: "Character's life feels continuous across years of gameplay"
  },
  
  examples: [
    {
      situation: "Season 5 health crisis (physical meter low)",
      echo: "Remember Season 1 collapse - 'You've been here before. You promised yourself: never again.'",
      impact: "Past consequences inform present choices"
    },
    {
      situation: "Season 4 decisive decision (career vs. relationship)",
      echo: "Remember Season 2 regret - 'Last time you chose career. They left. You regretted it for years.'",
      impact: "Learn from past mistakes, choose differently"
    },
    {
      situation: "Season 6 success moment (aspiration achieved)",
      echo: "Remember Season 3 when Sarah first believed in you - 'She knew before you did.'",
      impact: "Success feels earned, gratitude for support"
    }
  ],
  
  novel_integration: {
    echoes_become_narrative: "Emotional echoes are captured in novel generation",
    chapter_callbacks: "Novels reference past seasons' events",
    character_arc_visible: "Growth visible through recurring patterns (or breaking them)"
  }
};
```

### Memory Storage Tiers

**Tier 1: Recent Active (This Season)**
- All memories full detail
- Instantly accessible
- Used for echoes frequently

**Tier 2: Recent Complete (Last 1-2 Seasons)**
- High-weight memories full detail
- Medium-weight memories summarized
- Available for echoes

**Tier 3: Historical (3+ Seasons Ago)**
- High-weight memories preserved (weight 8+)
- Other memories compressed 50:1
- Major moments still echo-eligible

**Tier 4: Lifetime Archive (Character Complete)**
- All seasons' high-weight moments preserved
- Comprehensive but compressed
- Novel generated from this tier

## Summary

Unwritten's archive system now aligns with season-based progression:

- **Each season** = one complete story arc → generates one book
- **Multiple seasons** = character's ongoing life → generates collection/series
- **Lifetime end** = full character arc → generates complete novel
- **Continuation** = seamless season-to-season with persistent consequences
- **Archives** = organized by character > season > moments

**The book generation scales naturally:**
- 1 season = short story (3-5k words free, 12-15k premium)
- 3 seasons = novella/trilogy (~40k words)
- 7+ seasons = full novel or series (80-150k words)

Players can continue their character's life for as long as they want, with each season adding another chapter to their unique story.
