# Unwritten: Game Vision & Core Concept

## What is Unwritten?

Unwritten is a card-based life simulation game where players live stylized lives through drawn cards that represent situations, people, locations, and activities. The revolutionary element: cards **evolve uniquely** based on your choices, creating personalized stories that feel deeply meaningful.

---

## Core Player Fantasy

**Each character is a "life" that you live.** That life unfolds across **multiple seasons** (up to 8-10 chapters), with each season being a complete story arc with its own aspiration. Everything carries forward—relationships, skills, memories, personality evolution—creating a continuous narrative.

Between seasons, you choose what's next for your character:
- Build on your success (short time skip: months)
- Pivot to something new (moderate skip: 1-3 years)
- Complete life change (long skip: 3-10 years)

The game auto-generates what happened during time skips, keeping your story coherent.

**When you're done with a character** (by choice or reaching season 10), you have a complete "Life Bookshelf" of 8-10 novels telling their full story. Then you can create a new character for a fresh perspective.

---

## The Central Loop

Players live a stylized life through drawn cards (situations, locations, NPCs, skills, items) that affect four core meters: **Physical, Mental, Social, Emotional**. Extreme low/high values trigger events (hospital visit; burnout; breakthroughs). Time is split into day parts; cards cost energy + time.

Each run moves through phases:
- **Early** → meet many people, sample activities
- **Establishment** → career solidifies, first fusions
- **Peak** → complex fusions, major goals
- **Late** → legacy, meaning, preparation to end
- **Ending & Rebirth** → archive unique life, start again with small carryovers

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Cards Are Not Just Mechanics—They're Memories
Unlike traditional card games where cards are static, Unwritten cards **evolve** based on your unique choices:

**Generic Base Card:**
```
SARAH ANDERSON
Level 1 • Stranger
"Works at a coffee shop. Seems nice."
```

**Your Evolved Version After 100 Days:**
```
SARAH ANDERSON
Level 5 • Business Partner & Soulmate

"Sarah trusted you with her grandmother's dream.
Together you opened the bookshop she always wanted.
She cries when she talks about how you believed in her."

Memories: 47 shared moments
This card is unique to YOUR story.
```

### 2. True Emergent Storytelling
AI generates personalized narrative based on:
- Your play style and choices
- Relationship history with each NPC
- Life context (career, stress, recent events)
- Personality compatibility (OCEAN model)

No two playthroughs are the same. No two "Sarah Andersons" are the same.

### 3. Living Emotional States
Your character's emotions aren't just stats—they're a **lens that shapes every turn**. Feel overwhelmed? High-demand tasks feel harder and rest options feel more appealing. Feel inspired? Creative activities call to you.

The system automatically:
- Detects your emotional state from meters, events, and personality
- Filters which cards appear in your hand
- Modifies energy costs and success chances
- Creates authentic challenge ("I know I should, but I just don't feel like it")

Managing your emotional life becomes core gameplay.

### 4. Continuous Evolution & Legacy
Within a character's life, cards **continuously evolve** across all their seasons. Your Sarah from Season 1 becomes your business partner Sarah in Season 4, then your lifelong friend Sarah in Season 8. The evolution is permanent for that character.

When you **retire a character**, their complete story becomes a "Life Bookshelf" of novels you can revisit. Starting a **new character** gives you fresh perspectives and relationships.

This creates:
- **Deep attachment** to characters across multiple seasons
- **Meaningful progression** as relationships deepen over years
- **Complete life stories** (8-10 seasons = 120k-150k word saga)
- **Replayability** through different character perspectives

## Design Pillars

### 1. Personal & Unique
Every playthrough creates a story that belongs only to you. Your Sarah is not my Sarah.

### 2. Emotionally Authentic
Small moments matter more than big drama. "She recommended a book you didn't know you needed" beats "Epic confrontation!"

### 3. Meaningful Choices
Decisions feel weighty because they permanently change your unique cards.

### 4. Bittersweet Cycles
The pain of ending a run makes starting a new one meaningful.

### 5. Social Storytelling
Players become marketers by sharing their evolved cards and stories.

---

## Success Vision

**Players will:**
- Screenshot their favorite evolved cards
- Write about their NPCs like real people
- Share Archives like photo albums
- Say "Remember when Sarah..." about a videogame character
- Feel genuinely emotional when a run ends
- Come back repeatedly to see "what if?"

**The game becomes:**
A place where AI makes cards feel *alive*, where players don't just play—they *remember*.

### Cross-System Integration Examples

**Emotional States Drive Everything:**
```
You feel OVERWHELMED
  ↓
Turn Structure:
  → High-demand cards cost +1 energy
  → Rest cards appear more frequently
  → Social events less likely in hand
  
Card Evolution:
  → Vulnerable conversations trigger deeper bonds
  → Sarah notices you're struggling
  
Novel Generation:
  → Chapter tone reflects your overwhelm
  → Dialogue captures exhaustion authentically
```

**Decisions Echo Across Decades:**
```
Week 67: Invest $25k in Sarah's bookshop
  ↓
Immediate (Turn Structure):
  → Money = $0, new obligation cards appear
  → Business partner cards unlock
  
Medium-term (Progression):
  → New season arc: "Making the Bookshop Work"
  → Financial pressure mechanics
  
Long-term (Continuity):
  → Week 520: Still business partners
  → Canonical fact: Never contradicted
  → Novel Chapter 15: "The Partnership" (defining moment)
```

**Personality Evolution:**
```
Start: Anxious Creative [4.2, 3.1, 2.0, 3.8, 4.9]
  ↓
+ 150 weeks of risk-taking & creative success
  ↓
End: Confident Entrepreneur [4.8, 4.2, 3.8, 4.3, 3.2]

Effects:
