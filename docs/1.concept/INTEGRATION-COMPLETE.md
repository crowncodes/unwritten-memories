---

## What Was Added

### Three Major New Documents

#### **20-character-creation.md** (943 lines)
Complete 10-minute character creation system:
- Five-stage creation flow (biographical → personality → direction → status → setup)
- Scenario-based personality detection (6-8 questions reveal OCEAN traits)
- Nine life direction paths with gameplay effects
- Starting deck generation algorithm
- First week goal selection
- Full JSON output structure

**Integration:** Feeds into turn structure, emotional states, NPC compatibility, and novel generation voice profiles.

#### **21-turn-structure.md** (Comprehensive gameplay loop)
Multi-scale time architecture:
- **MICRO (30sec-2min):** Individual card plays with AI micro-narratives
- **MESO (10-15min):** Day structure (morning/afternoon/evening)
- **MACRO (45-60min):** Weekly cycles with end-of-week processing
- Emotional state filtering of hand composition
- Adaptive pacing (granular, batched, summary)
- Multi-resource card costs (energy, time, money, comfort zone, social capital)
- Turn-to-novel data tracking

**Integration:** Core gameplay loop that connects all systems - card evolution happens here, emotional states filter here, continuity tracks here.

#### **22-multi-lifetime-continuity.md** (Long-term consistency)
Systems for 3000+ week playthroughs without contradictions:
- **Four-tier context management:**
  - Tier 1: Last 12 weeks (full detail, ~2MB)
  - Tier 2: Last 50 weeks (summarized, ~5MB)
  - Tier 3: Entire life compressed 50:1 (~10MB)
  - Tier 4: Current character state (~1MB)
- Canonical facts system (prevents contradictions)
- NPC lifecycle (parallel lives, aging, leaving, returning)
- Identity evolution tracking
- Memory compression strategy

**Integration:** Ensures consistency across decades, feeds novel generation, tracks NPC evolution, maintains canonical truths.

## How Everything Connects Now

### The Complete Flow

```
1. CHARACTER CREATION (20-character-creation.md)
   ↓ Personality, direction, starting state
   
2. TURN STRUCTURE (21-turn-structure.md)
   ↓ Daily gameplay loop
   ├─ Emotional states filter hand (19-emotional-state-system.md)
   ├─ Cards evolve through play (12-card-evolution.md)
   ├─ Fusions discovered (14-fusion-combinations.md)
   └─ NPCs respond authentically (13-ai-personality-system.md)
   
3. SEASON PROGRESSION (15-progression-phases.md)
   ↓ 12-100 week story arcs
   
4. MULTI-LIFETIME CONTINUITY (22-multi-lifetime-continuity.md)
   ↓ 3000+ weeks without contradictions
   
5. ARCHIVE & NOVEL GENERATION (16-archive-persistence.md + novel-generation-data-structure.md)
   ↓ Your life becomes literature
```

### Every System Cross-References

**Before:** Documents existed in isolation  
**After:** Every document links to related systems with specific integration notes

**Example - Card Evolution:**
- References turn structure (when evolution happens)
- References continuity (how evolution tracked long-term)
- References novel generation (evolution as chapter beats)
- References archives (evolution sequences preserved)

### Data Structures Unified

**Before:** Some docs had partial data structures  
**After:** 
- 18-json-contracts.md covers game data
- 20-character-creation.md has character JSON
- 21-turn-structure.md has turn state JSON
- 22-multi-lifetime-continuity.md has four-tier structures
- novel-generation-data-structure.md has chapter packets

All interconnected and referenced across docs.

## Next Steps (If Continuing)

The documentation is now comprehensive and integrated. Possible next additions:

1. **Tutorial flow document** - How onboarding works
2. **UI/UX specifications** - Screen-by-screen
3. **Analytics tracking** - What to measure
4. **Localization strategy** - Multi-language support
5. **Accessibility features** - Inclusive design
6. **Social features** - Sharing, community
7. **Platform-specific** - iOS vs Android considerations
8. **Version 2.0 features** - Future expansion ideas

But the **core game design is now fully documented and integrated**.
