# Unwritten: Fusion & Combination System

## Fusion Philosophy

When cards are played together in the same context, they don't just add effects‚Äîthey can **fuse** into entirely new cards that remember the combination. This creates emergent gameplay where your choices create unique cards that can only exist in YOUR playthrough.

**Integration:** Fusions happen during turn resolution (see `21-turn-structure.md` ‚Üí Card Resolution). The emotional state system (`19-emotional-state-system.md`) can increase fusion success chance when in certain states like INSPIRED or MOTIVATED.

## Fusion Types

### 1. Simple Fusion (2 Cards)

**Most common, creates evolved versions**

```
[Card A] + [Card B] = [Evolved Card]
```

**Example:**
```
[SARAH] + [COFFEE MEETUP]
         ‚Üì
[SARAH Level 2 - with memory of that coffee date]
```

---

### 2. Triple Fusion (3 Cards)

**More specific, creates unique moments**

```
[Character] + [Activity] + [Emotion]
              ‚Üì
      [Unique Memory Card]
```

**Example:**
```
[SARAH] + [BOOKSTORE] + [EXCITEMENT]
                ‚Üì
        ["THE BOOKSHOP DREAM"]
        Quest card that unlocks business path
```

---

### 3. Complex Fusion (4+ Cards)

**Rare, creates legendary outcomes**

```
[Multiple specific cards] + [Right timing] + [High relationships]
                     ‚Üì
              [Legendary Card]
```

**Example:**
```
[SARAH Lvl 4] + [BOOKSHOP LOCATION] + [YOUR SAVINGS] + [BUSINESS PLAN]
                           ‚Üì
                 ["THE BOOKSHOP OPENING"]
                  Life-changing event card
```

---

### 4. Chain Fusion

**Evolved card + new card = further evolution**

```
[Previously Evolved Card] + [New Card]
              ‚Üì
      [Next Evolution]
```

**Example:**
```
[SARAH Lvl 2] + [HELP MOVE]
        ‚Üì
[SARAH Lvl 3 - now close friend]
        ‚Üì
[SARAH Lvl 3] + [CRISIS SUPPORT]
        ‚Üì
[SARAH Lvl 4 - best friend]
```

---

### 5. Conditional Fusion

**Requires specific context to unlock**

```
[Cards] + [Context Requirements Met]
              ‚Üì
       [Special Fusion]
```

**Context Requirements:**
- Minimum relationship level
- Specific life phase
- Previous memory requirements
- Time of year/location
- Player career/skills

## Fusion Requirements System

### Level-Gated Fusions

**Certain fusions require minimum relationship levels:**

```
Basic Fusion:
Any level - Creates memories, evolves cards

Deep Fusion:
Level 3+ - Unlocks personal quests

Major Fusion:
Level 4+ - Life-changing decisions

Legendary Fusion:
Level 5 - Ultimate story climax moments
```

---

### Time-Gated Fusions

**Some fusions need time to develop:**

```
Immediate:
First meeting, casual interactions

Short-term (1-2 weeks):
Becoming friends, surface bonding

Medium-term (4-8 weeks):
Deep friendship, trust building

Long-term (12+ weeks):
Best friendship, life partnership

Epic (24+ weeks):
Legendary bonds, life-defining
```

---

### Context-Gated Fusions

**Specific conditions must be met:**

**Location Requirements:**
```
"Intimate Conversation" fusion:
Requires: Private location (home, quiet caf√©)
Cannot happen: Public spaces, work, crowded areas
```

**Timing Requirements:**
```
"Late Night Heart-to-Heart" fusion:
Requires: Evening time slot
Bonus: After stressful day
```

**Emotional State Requirements:**
```
"Breakthrough Moment" fusion:
Requires: High trust (0.7+)
Requires: Vulnerability emotion active
Requires: No recent conflicts
```

**Life Phase Requirements:**
```
"Starting Business Together" fusion:
Requires: Establishment or Peak phase
Blocked: Early phase (too soon)
Blocked: Late phase (too late)
```

---

## Fusion Failures & Alternatives

### What Happens When Fusion Fails

**Not all combinations work:**

**Incompatible Personalities:**
```
[High Neuroticism NPC] + [Risky Activity] + [Pressure]
         ‚Üì
"They weren't comfortable. Probably shouldn't
have pushed. Relationship: -0.1"
```

**Wrong Timing:**
```
[BUSINESS PROPOSAL] + [SARAH Lvl 1]
         ‚Üì
"Too soon. She barely knows you. This feels pushy.
Relationship: -0.2"
```

**Insufficient Trust:**
```
[VULNERABLE CONFESSION] + [Trust < 0.4]
         ‚Üì
"They're not ready to open up. The moment feels forced."
```

---

### Alternative Outcomes

**Failed fusions create different cards:**

```
Instead of: [INTIMATE BOND CARD]
You get: [AWKWARD MOMENT CARD]

"You tried to get deep but they weren't ready.
Lesson learned: timing matters."

Effects:
‚Ä¢ -0.1 relationship
‚Ä¢ +Player wisdom about boundaries
‚Ä¢ Future opportunities to try again right way
```

---

## Fusion Discovery

### How Players Learn Combos

**Hint System:**
```
When viewing a card:
"This card can combine with..."
‚Ä¢ Activity cards
‚Ä¢ Location: Caf√©
‚Ä¢ Best with: High trust NPCs
```

**Natural Discovery:**
```
Player plays cards together naturally
         ‚Üì
Game detects potential fusion
         ‚Üì
"Something special happened..."
         ‚Üì
New fusion card revealed
```

**Experimentation Rewards:**
```
Players who try unusual combinations:
[SARAH] + [CEMETERY] + [FLOWERS] + [GRANDMOTHER STORY]
         ‚Üì
Discovers rare fusion:
["HONORING MEMORY" Unique Card]

## Mathematical Possibilities

### Fusion Math

**Base cards: 470**

**2-Card Combinations:**
- 470 √ó 469 = 220,630 possible pairs
- ~50,000 meaningful combinations
- ~10,000 unique evolutions

**3-Card Combinations:**
- Millions of possibilities
- ~5,000 programmed unique fusions
- AI generates context-specific others

**4+ Card Combinations:**
- Billions of theoretical combinations
- ~500 legendary pre-defined fusions
- Infinite AI-generated unique moments

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Meaningful Combinations
Not all cards should combine. Only combinations that make narrative sense.

### 2. Discovery Joy
Finding new fusion should feel special, not overwhelming.

### 3. Earned Rewards
Best fusions require investment, not luck.

### 4. Unique Stories
Your fusion results should differ from other players'.

### 5. Memory Creation
Every fusion creates a moment worth remembering.

---

## Technical Implementation

### Fusion Detection

```javascript
function detectFusion(cardsPlayed) {
  // Check for predefined fusion recipes
  const recipe = FUSION_RECIPES.find(r => 
    r.cards.every(card => cardsPlayed.includes(card.type))
  );
  
  if (recipe) {
    // Check requirements
    if (meetsRequirements(recipe, gameState)) {
      return generateFusion(recipe);
    }
  }
  
  // Fall back to AI generation for novel combinations
  return generateNovelFusion(cardsPlayed, context);
}
```

---

### Fusion Caching

```javascript
// Cache common fusions
const FUSION_CACHE = {
  'sarah_coffee_5x': pregenerated_evolution_2,
  'sarah_bookstore_excited': bookshop_dream_card,
  // ...
};

// Generate new for unique combinations
if (!FUSION_CACHE[fusionKey]) {
  FUSION_CACHE[fusionKey] = await AI.generate(fusion);
}
```

---

## Player Experience Goals

**Players should:**
- Experiment with combinations
- Discover surprising fusions
- Plan complex fusion chains
- Share unique fusions socially
- Feel rewarded for investment

**Players should feel:**
- Clever when finding rare fusions
- Invested in fusion outcomes
- Excited by discovery
- Proud of unique cards created
- Motivated to try new combinations

---

## Integration with Core Systems

### Turn Structure (`21-turn-structure.md`)
**Fusion During Turn Resolution:**

```javascript
async function resolveCard(card, gameState) {
  // 1. Apply base effects
  applyEffects(card, gameState);
  
  // 2. Check for fusion opportunities
  if (card.combinable_with && gameState.active_cards.length > 0) {
    const fusionResult = checkFusions(card, gameState.active_cards);
    
    if (fusionResult) {
      displayFusionAnimation(fusionResult);
      addToDeck(fusionResult.new_card);
      
      // Track for novel generation
      trackFusionEvent({
        cards_fused: fusionResult.source_cards,
        result: fusionResult.new_card,
        context: gameState.narrative_context,
        emotional_weight: 8 // Fusions are memorable
      });
    }
  }
  
  return resolution;
}
```

**Fusion Discovery:**
- Some fusions only appear in specific emotional states
- Time of day affects available fusions (evening more reflective fusions)
- Energy level can gate high-energy fusion attempts

### Emotional States (`19-emotional-state-system.md`)
**State-Modified Fusion Chances:**

```javascript
const EMOTIONAL_FUSION_MODIFIERS = {
  INSPIRED: {
    creative_fusions: "+30% success",
    unlocks: ["Unique artistic combinations"]
  },
  
  MOTIVATED: {
    aspiration_fusions: "+25% success",
    unlocks: ["Goal-related fusion chains"]
  },
  
  PASSIONATE: {
    relationship_fusions: "+40% success",
    intensity: "Stronger emotional bonds created"
  },
  
  ANXIOUS: {
    safe_fusions: "+15% success",
    risky_fusions: "-20% success",
    note: "Hesitant to try bold combinations"
  }
};
```

### Multi-Lifetime Continuity (`22-multi-lifetime-continuity.md`)
**Tracking Fusion History:**

All legendary fusions are preserved as canonical facts:

```javascript
const CANONICAL_FUSIONS = {
  week_67: {
    fusion: "Sarah Level 3 (Business Partner)",
    source_cards: ["Sarah Level 2", "Investment Decision", "Bookshop Lease"],
    context: "Decisive moment - invested life savings",
    never_forgotten: true,
    referenced_in_novel: true
  }
};
```

**Fusion Evolution Across Decades:**
- Early fusion cards can evolve further over time
- Legendary fusions from Week 67 influence cards available at Week 520
- Novel generation references major fusions as defining moments

### Novel Generation (`novel-generation-data-structure.md`)
**Fusions as Chapter Beats:**

Major fusions often become chapter-worthy moments:

```markdown
## Chapter 15: "The Partnership"

You signed the papers at 3:47pm on a Tuesday. Sarah's hands 
trembled as she added her signature next to yours. Fifty-fifty. 
Partners. The number $25,000 sat heavy in your mind‚Äîevery dollar 
of your savings, now invested in a dream that wasn't even yours 
to begin with.

But it was now.

[This chapter generated from LEGENDARY FUSION event at Week 67]
```

### Archive System (`16-archive-persistence.md`)
**Fusion Gallery:**
- Archive contains "Fusion Gallery" showing all major fusions
- Screenshots of legendary fusion animations
- Timeline of fusion discoveries
- Novel references fusion moments as key story beats
