# Unwritten Monetization - Future Revenue Streams

**Status:** Future Roadmap (Year 2-3+)  
**Last Updated:** October 13, 2025  
**Purpose:** Long-term monetization ideas for mature player base

---

## Overview

After Unwritten is established (300k+ players, 2-3 years post-launch), these additional revenue streams become viable. All maintain the ethical, player-first approach.

## 1. Physical Book Printing Service

### The Concept

**Players can order THEIR Life Bookshelf as physical books.**

```
Assumption: 5% of players order physical books
= 15,000 orders

Average order: $40 (mix of paperback/hardcover)
Average margin: $15 per order

Annual revenue: 15,000 × $15 = $225,000/year

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Passive income from gameplay
- ✅ Share their stories with the world
- ✅ Physical keepsake of their game experience
- ✅ Recognition and validation
- ✅ Community connection

**Motivation:**
- Players already create these stories (through gameplay)
- Publishing is opt-in, not required
- Zero additional work (stories auto-generated)
- Earnings are bonus, not expectation

---

### For Unwritten (Platform)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ New revenue stream (30% of all story sales)
- ✅ Expands beyond game players (story readers)
- ✅ Self-sustaining content ecosystem
- ✅ Viral marketing (shared stories attract new players)
- ✅ Print-on-demand has high margins

**Strategic Value:**
- Stories become marketing for the game
- Platform builds moat (unique content library)
- Creates network effects
- Low marginal cost (content is player-generated)

---

### For Readers (Non-players)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Access to unique, real life simulation stories
- ✅ Support indie creators (players)
- ✅ Discover stories by genre/theme
- ✅ Low-cost entertainment ($2.99-9.99 per story)
- ✅ No need to play game (optional entry point)

---

## Ethical Considerations

### Player Consent

**Requirements:**
- ✅ Explicit opt-in to publish
- ✅ Choose pricing or free
- ✅ Can unpublish anytime
- ✅ Control over what's shared (privacy settings)
- ✅ Clear terms on revenue split

**Default: Private**
- Stories are private by default
- Player must actively choose to publish
- Can share with friends only (no public listing)

---

### Content Moderation

**To protect platform:**
- ✅ AI content filtering (no explicit content)
- ✅ Manual review for featured stories
- ✅ Report system for inappropriate content
- ✅ Author reputation system
- ✅ Quality standards for monetization

---

### Revenue Expectations

**Set realistic expectations:**
- Most authors earn $10-100 total (hobby)
- Top 10% earn $100-1000/year (nice bonus)
- Top 1% earn $1000+/year (meaningful income)
- NOT positioned as "make money from gaming"
- Positioned as "share your story + optional earnings"

---

**vs Wattpad/AO3:**
