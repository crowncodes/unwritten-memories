# Unwritten: Progression & Season System

## Overview

Unwritten uses a **flexible season-based structure** rather than fixed day counts. Each "season" is a chapter of your life with its own goal, lasting **12-100 weeks** depending on complexity. This allows both focused short stories and epic multi-year sagas.

---

## Time Scale Architecture

```
MICRO (30sec-2min):    Individual card plays
         ↓
MESO (10-15min):       Day structure (morning/afternoon/evening)
         ↓
MACRO (45-60min):      Weekly cycles
         ↓
MEGA (8-12 hours):     Seasons (variable 12-100 weeks)
         ↓
ULTRA (Lifetime):      Life phases & multi-season arcs
```

---

## Season Structure (Core Unit)

### Season Length Options

**Three fixed lengths available:**
- **Standard Season:** 12 weeks (3 months)
- **Extended Season:** 24 weeks (6 months)  
- **Epic Season:** 36 weeks (9 months)

**Choosing Season Length:**

At the start of each season, you select both your aspiration AND how much time to commit:

```

│ ○ Standard (12 weeks)                 │
│   Fast-paced, focused story            │
│   Best for: Single focused goal        │
│                                        │
│ ○ Extended (24 weeks)                 │
│   Deeper development, complications    │
│   Best for: Complex goal + life        │
│                                        │
│ ○ Epic (36 weeks)                     │
│   Multi-arc saga, major life changes   │
│   Best for: Transformational journey   │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What Changes With Length:**
- **Content density** (12w = focused sprint, 36w = layered complexity)
- **Complication frequency** (longer = more crisis events, subplots)
- **Relationship depth** (more time = deeper bonds possible)
- **Story richness** (longer = more memories, character development)

**What Stays Constant:**
- Three-act structure (every season has Setup → Conflict → Resolution)
- Season goal achievement (all lengths can succeed)
- Save/quit options (can end early if goal completes)

### The Three-Act Season

Every season follows a narrative arc, regardless of length:

```

## Emotional State Integration

### States Influence Season Experience

**During Season Start (Act I):**
- CURIOUS states more common (exploring)
- MOTIVATED states if goal appeals
- ANXIOUS states if goal intimidating

**During Season Middle (Act II):**
- OVERWHELMED states from juggling
- FRUSTRATED states from obstacles
- PASSIONATE states from commitment
- DISCOURAGED states from setbacks

**During Season End (Act III):**
- ANXIOUS states before climax
- CONFIDENT states if prepared
- EXHAUSTED states from sustained effort
- RELIEVED states after resolution

## Design Principles

### 1. Flexible Structure
Seasons expand/contract based on story complexity, not arbitrary limits.

### 2. Three-Act Storytelling
Every season has narrative structure: setup → conflict → resolution.

### 3. Goal Evolution
Each season's outcome shapes next season's possibilities.

### 4. Consistency Tracking
Canonical facts prevent contradictions across long playthroughs.

### 5. Phase Awareness
Long-term character progression visible through phases.

## Player Experience Goals

**Players should feel:**
- Seasons have natural narrative arcs
- Their choices extend or conclude seasons organically
- Character growth visible across seasons
- Each season is its own complete story
- Long-term continuity maintained

**Players should never feel:**
- Arbitrarily rushed through content
- Stuck in overlong seasons
- Confused by contradictions
- Disconnected from past seasons
- Overwhelmed by complexity

## Technical Notes

### Season Length Calculation

```javascript
function calculateSeasonLength(aspiration, character, events) {
  let baseWeeks = aspiration.base_duration; // 12-20
  
  // Add time for complexity
  baseWeeks += character.active_arcs.length * 5;
  
  // Add time for decisive decisions
  baseWeeks += events.decisive_decisions.length * 8;
  
  // Add time for crises
  baseWeeks += events.crises.length * 5;
  
  // Add time for relationship complications
  baseWeeks += events.relationship_drama.length * 12;
  
  // Cap at reasonable maximum
  return Math.min(baseWeeks, 100);
}
```

## Summary

Unwritten's progression system uses **seasons** (12-100 weeks) as the primary unit, each with its own three-act structure. Characters progress through **life phases** that provide overarching context. This allows both focused 12-week stories and epic 100-week sagas, with **goal evolution** ensuring each season builds naturally on what came before.

**Key Insight:** The system adapts to player choices. A simple goal creates a clean 12-week season. A goal that spawns complications, crises, and tough choices organically extends to 50+ weeks. The player's decisions determine the length, not arbitrary timers.
