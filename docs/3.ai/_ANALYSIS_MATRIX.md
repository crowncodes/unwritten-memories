## Redundancy Analysis

### Major Overlaps Identified:

1. **Genkit Tutorial + Integration Guide**
   - genkit_implementation_tutorial.md has SIGNIFICANT overlap with genkit_integration_guide.md
   - **Action:** Merge tutorial INTO integration guide as "Getting Started" section

2. **Firebase AI Quick Start + Integration Guide**
   - firebase_ai_flutter_quick_start.md overlaps with firebase_ai_logic_integration_guide.md
   - **Action:** Consolidate into single guide with quick start section OR keep both with clear differentiation (30-min quickstart vs complete reference)

3. **Meta-Documents (INDEX, SUMMARY)**
   - GENKIT_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md redundant with 00-INDEX.md
   - GENKIT_DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md redundant with README.md
   - AI_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md redundant after reorganization
   - **Action:** Archive or merge useful content into README.md and 00-INDEX.md

4. **Compliance Reports**
   - ADHERENCE_ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md + COMPLETE_V1.2_COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md cover similar ground
   - **Action:** Merge into single **81-compliance-reports.md**

5. **Cost Information**
   - 30-ai-architecture-overview.md has cost info
   - 39-cost-performance-targets.md is dedicated to costs
   - **Action:** Keep both - 30 has strategic overview, 39 is detailed analysis (different purposes)
