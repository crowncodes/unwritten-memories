### 6.4 Monetization System Validation

**Schema**: `09-monetization-schema.md`
**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** with 🔄 **DIVERGENCES**
**Priority**: **P1**

| Element | Schema | Implementation | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------------|--------|-------|
| Tier names | Free/Casual/Premium | 🔄 Free/Plus/Ultimate | 🔄 | **Name divergence** |
| Daily essence | Free=25 | ✅ 25/75/unlimited | ⚠️ | Different values |
| Subscription pricing | $4.99 monthly | ✅ $4.99/$9.99 | ⚠️ | Two tiers |
| Essence packages | 4 packages | ❌ Not found | ❌ | IAP missing |
| Expansion packs | $4.99-$7.99 | ❌ Not found | ❌ | Content DLC |
| Book generation costs | 0 or 250 essence | ⚠️ Defined but not enforced | ⚠️ | Pricing exists |
| Archive limits | 3 vs unlimited | ❌ Not enforced | ❌ | Feature missing |
| Entitlement tracking | ✅ Full system | ❌ Not found | ❌ | Access control |

**DIVERGENCE ANALYSIS - Tier Naming**:

Schema Model:
```
Free Tier: Base game
Casual Tier: Has made purchases, no active subscription
Premium Tier: Active subscription
```

Implementation Model:
```dart
enum SubscriptionTier {
  free,      // 25 essence/day, Gemini Flash 2.5
  plus,      // $4.99/mo, 75 essence/day, Gemini Pro 1.5
  ultimate,  // $9.99/mo, unlimited, Gemini Pro 2.5
}
```

**Critical Determination (🔄→✅)**:

**Implementation model is BETTER**:
1. ✅ Clearer naming (Plus/Ultimate vs Casual/Premium)
2. ✅ Two subscription tiers provide better monetization
3. ✅ Simpler mental model for users
4. ❌ Loses "Casual" concept (user who made purchases but no subscription)

**Recommendation**:
1. **Keep implementation tier names** (Free/Plus/Ultimate)
2. **Add "Casual" as a boolean flag**, not a tier:
   ```dart
   class PlayerTier {
     final SubscriptionTier tier;
     final bool hasMadePurchases;  // "Casual" flag
   }
   ```
3. **Update schema** to match implementation
4. **Implement missing features**:
   - Essence package IAP
   - Entitlement tracking
   - Archive limit enforcement

**Schema Actions**:
- [ ] Rename tiers in `09-monetization-schema.md`
- [ ] Add "Casual" as status flag, not tier
- [ ] Document Plus (75 essence) and Ultimate (unlimited)
- [ ] Update pricing model

1. **`02-card-system.md`** - Card Tier Clarification
   ```markdown
   ## Card Tiers vs Card Types
   
   **Card Tiers** (Content Design Tool):
   - 7 numerical tiers for organizing 1000+ cards
   - Foundation (1) → System (7)
   - Used by content creators for card organization
   
   **Card Types** (Implementation Model):
   - 7 flat types used in code
   - lifeDirection, aspiration, relationship, activity, routine, place, item
   - Maps to multiple tiers (e.g., `activity` can be Tier 5-6)
   
   **Mapping**:
   - Foundation (1) → lifeDirection
   - Aspiration (2) → aspiration
   - Structure (3) → routine, place
   - Quest (4) → (future) milestone cards
   - Activity (5) → activity
   - Event (6) → (future) event cards
   - System (7) → item, relationship
   ```

2. **`07-ai-integration.md`** - Hybrid Architecture
   ```markdown
   ## AI Architecture: Hybrid Cloud/Local
   
   **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Firebase Cloud AI

     Premium = "premium"     // Active subscription
   }
   
   // NEW (Implementation - BETTER)
   enum SubscriptionTier {
     free = "free",         // 25 essence/day
     plus = "plus",         // $4.99/mo, 75 essence/day
     ultimate = "ultimate"  // $9.99/mo, unlimited
   }
   
   // Add "Casual" as boolean flag
   interface PlayerTier {
     tier: SubscriptionTier;
     hasMadePurchases: boolean;  // "Casual" status
   }
   ```

4. **`01-core-types.md`** - Minor Updates
   - Energy range: 0-8 typical → 0-10 max
   - Relationship Level 0: "Stranger" → "Not Met" (internal only)

## Conclusion

The schema validation reveals a **well-designed but incomplete** implementation. The schemas are **comprehensive and high-quality**, with only minor over-engineering. The implementation has **excellent foundations** but is missing **core gameplay systems** (emotional, narrative, persistence).

**Key Takeaway**: The gap is **not in design quality** but in **implementation completeness**. The schemas provide an excellent roadmap, and following them with the recommended phasing will result in a strong, cohesive game.

**Recommendation**: **Proceed with phased implementation** using schemas as guide, with the following priorities:
1. **Immediate**: Save system (P0)
2. **Phase 1**: Core gameplay (turns, meters, emotions)
3. **Phase 2**: Story systems (arcs, decisions)
4. **Phase 3**: Polish and enhancement
