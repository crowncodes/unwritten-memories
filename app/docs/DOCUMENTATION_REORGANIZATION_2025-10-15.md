# Documentation Reorganization Summary

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Goal:** Align app documentation with `master_flutter_flame_spec_v_1_0.md` and remove I/O FLIP references

---

## What Changed

### 1. Removed I/O FLIP Architecture

**Problem:** Existing `ARCHITECTURE.md` was entirely about I/O FLIP (multiplayer game with Dart Frog backend), which is not applicable to Unwritten's single-player architecture.

**Solution:**
- Moved `ARCHITECTURE.md` to `_archive/2025-10-15/IOFLIP_REFERENCE.md`
- Clearly marked as external reference study only
- Removed all Dart Frog references from main documentation

### 2. Created Numbered Documentation Structure

**New Structure:**
```
app/docs/
├── 00-overview/          # Quick start, performance, principles (3 files)
├── 01-architecture/      # Project structure, Clean Architecture (4 planned)
├── 02-flame-engine/      # Complete Flame guide (10 files) ✅ COMPLETE
├── 03-state-management/  # Riverpod patterns (3 planned)
├── 04-audio-visuals/     # Audio, music, haptics, effects (5 planned)
├── 05-performance/       # 60 FPS guidelines (4 planned)
├── 06-integration/       # Firebase, AI, storage (3 planned)
└── _archive/             # Historical reference material
```

### 3. Created Comprehensive Flame Documentation

**Complete (10 files):**
1. `00-INDEX.md` - Navigation and overview
2. `01-component-system.md` - Lifecycle, hierarchy, keys, queries (3,441 lines)
3. `02-game-loop-lifecycle.md` - FlameGame structure, update loop (2,876 lines)
4. `03-sprite-animation-system.md` - Multi-state animations, callbacks (3,051 lines)
5. `04-particle-effects.md` - GPU-accelerated effects, pooling (2,795 lines)
6. `05-effects-system.md` - MoveEffect, ScaleEffect, chaining (2,309 lines)
7. `06-camera-viewport.md` - Fixed resolution, responsive (647 lines)
8. `07-collision-detection.md` - Hitboxes, collision types (650 lines)
9. `08-input-handling.md` - Tap, drag, hover, gestures (2,250 lines)
10. `09-performance-optimization.md` - 60 FPS, pooling, culling (1,542 lines)
11. `10-flame-riverpod-integration.md` - Manual integration patterns (995 lines)

**Total:** ~20,000 lines of Flame documentation, all aligned with master spec.

### 4. Updated Package Documentation

**Updated Files:**
- `flame.md` - Now references comprehensive Flame docs, shows card-specific quick start
- `README.flutter.md` - Removed Dart Frog, updated navigation to numbered structure
- Updated cross-references throughout

### 5. Created Supporting Documentation

**New Files:**
- `00-overview/00-INDEX.md` - Master navigation
- `00-overview/01-quick-start.md` - Setup and first build
- `00-overview/02-performance-targets.md` - Detailed metrics
- `00-overview/03-architecture-principles.md` - Core architectural decisions
- `01-architecture/00-INDEX.md` - Architecture section navigation
- `01-architecture/01-project-structure.md` - Directory layout
- Index files for sections 03-06

---

## Files Created

### Comprehensive Documentation (13 new files)
- 10 × Flame engine docs (`02-flame-engine/*.md`)
- 3 × Overview docs (`00-overview/*.md`)
- 2 × Architecture docs (`01-architecture/*.md`)
- 4 × Section index files (`03-06/**/00-INDEX.md`)

### Files Updated (3)
- `flame.md` - Simplified to quick reference
- `README.flutter.md` - Removed I/O FLIP, updated navigation
- `_archive/2025-10-15/IOFLIP_REFERENCE.md` - Moved from `ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Success Criteria ✅

- [x] Zero references to Dart Frog or I/O FLIP multiplayer
- [x] All Flame documentation follows `master_flutter_flame_spec_v_1_0.md`
- [x] Code examples show Unwritten card game context
- [x] Clear numbered navigation structure
- [x] Performance targets (60 FPS, battery, memory) documented
- [x] Package docs updated with Flame integration references

---

## Documentation Philosophy

1. **Master Spec is Authoritative:** All app docs derive from `docs/master_flutter_flame_spec_v_1_0.md`
2. **Flame-First:** Game engine is primary, Flutter is UI overlay
3. **Performance First:** Every doc emphasizes 60 FPS and battery life
4. **Practical Examples:** All docs include Unwritten-specific card game code
5. **Numbered Structure:** Easy navigation, clear hierarchy

---

## Migration Notes

### For Developers

- **Old:** Referenced `ARCHITECTURE.md` for patterns
- **New:** Use numbered docs in `00-06/` folders
- **Flame:** Start with `02-flame-engine/00-INDEX.md`

### For Contributors

- **Structure:** Follow numbered folder convention
- **Examples:** Always show Unwritten card game context
- **Performance:** Include frame time/battery impact notes
- **Master Spec:** Reference line numbers from master spec
