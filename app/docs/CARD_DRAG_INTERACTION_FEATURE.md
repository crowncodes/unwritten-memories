# üé¥ Card Drag Interaction Feature

## üéØ Overview

Implemented interactive card drag behavior for the Unwritten Flutter app, allowing players to physically interact with cards in a more engaging way.

## üìñ Feature Description

### üîÑ Interaction Flow

1. **Initial State**: Cards are displayed in a fan layout at the bottom of the screen
2. **Tap/Click**: User taps a card to make it active and hover above the deck
3. **Tap & Release (Active Card)**: Card is played immediately
4. **Tap & Hold (Deck Card)**: Card becomes active and attaches to pointer at bottom-middle pivot point
5. **Tap & Hold (Active Card)**: Card re-attaches to pointer for dragging
6. **Drag**: Card follows pointer/finger position while attached
7. **Release**: Card returns to active hover position with smooth animation
8. **Tap Outside**: Dismisses active card, returns it to deck position

### üîß Technical Implementation

## üìÇ Files Modified

### 1. `card_hand_fan_controller.dart`
**Purpose**: Manages hover and drag state coordination

**Key Changes**:
- Added `_isDragging` state flag
- Added `_dragPosition` to track pointer location
- New methods:
  - `startDrag(Offset position)` - Initiates drag interaction
  - `updateDrag(Offset position)` - Updates drag position
  - `endDrag()` - Completes drag and returns to hover

**Code Structure**:
```dart
class CardHandFanController extends ChangeNotifier {
  int? _activeIndex;
  bool _isDragging = false;
  Offset _dragPosition = Offset.zero;
  
  // Getters
  bool get isDragging => _isDragging;
  Offset get dragPosition => _dragPosition;
  
  // State management methods
  void startDrag(Offset position) { ... }
  void updateDrag(Offset position) { ... }
  void endDrag() { ... }
}
```

### 2. `card_hand_fan_widget.dart`
**Purpose**: Renders cards with interactive drag behavior

**Major Changes**:

#### State Management
- Added `_draggingIndex` to track which card is being dragged
- Added `_dragOffset` to store current drag position
- Integrated with controller for state synchronization

#### Gesture Detection
- **Tap**: Quick tap plays the card (existing behavior)
- **Long Press**: Initiates drag on deck cards
  - `onLongPressStart` - Begin dragging
  - `onLongPressMoveUpdate` - Update drag position
  - `onLongPressEnd` - Release and return to hover
- **Pan Gestures**: Handles click-hold-drag on active cards
  - `onPanStart` - Begin dragging active card
  - `onPanUpdate` - Track pointer movement
  - `onPanEnd` - Release drag

#### Card Rendering
Two rendering modes:

**Fanned Card** (Default/Hover State):
```dart
Widget _buildFannedCard(...) {
  // Standard card in deck position
  // Scales up to 2.5x when hovered
  // Floats with subtle animation when active
}
```

**Dragging Card** (Drag State):
```dart
Widget _buildDraggingCard(...) {
  // Card attached at bottom-middle pivot point
  // Position: pointer.y - cardHeight (bottom edge at pointer)
  // Position: pointer.x - (cardWidth / 2) (centered horizontally)
  // Blue glow shadow to indicate dragging state
}
```

#### Pivot Point Calculation
```dart
// Bottom-middle attachment point
final scaledWidth = cardWidth * cardScale;
final scaledHeight = cardHeight * cardScale;

final left = _dragOffset.dx - (scaledWidth / 2);  // Center horizontally
final top = _dragOffset.dy - scaledHeight;        // Bottom edge at pointer
```

### 3. Bug Fixes & Optimization üêõ

#### Deprecated API Updates ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Replaced `Colors.withOpacity()` with `Colors.withValues(alpha:)` throughout
- Fixed Flutter 3.x deprecation warnings

#### Test Updates ‚úÖ
- Fixed `test/widget_test.dart` to use `UnwrittenApp` instead of non-existent `MyApp`
- Updated test to properly verify game screen loading
- Removed unused imports

#### Linter Fixes üßπ
- Removed unnecessary `foundation.dart` import in controller
- Fixed unused variable warnings in providers
- Removed unused imports in test files

## üë§ User Experience

### üëÅÔ∏è Visual Feedback

**Hover State**:
- Card scales to 2.5x
- Elevates 170px above deck
- Purple/black shadow glow
- Gentle floating animation (¬±8px)

**Drag State**:
- Card scales to 2.5x
- Blue/black shadow glow (different from hover)
- Follows pointer precisely at pivot point
- No rotation (stays upright)

**Deck State**:
- Cards fan out in arc formation
- Slight rotation based on position
- Overlapping with dynamic spacing
- Subtle shadows

### ‚≠ê Interaction Benefits

1. **Intuitive**: Mimics physical card handling
2. **Responsive**: Immediate visual feedback
3. **Forgiving**: Easy to return card without playing
4. **Satisfying**: Smooth animations and transitions
5. **Accessible**: Works with touch, mouse, and trackpad

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

### ‚úÖ Optimizations Applied

1. **Const Constructors**: Used throughout for widget rebuilding efficiency
2. **Animation Controllers**: Single float controller shared across cards
3. **Stable Keys**: ValueKey on card list items
4. **State Isolation**: Drag state only rebuilds affected widgets
5. **Gesture Batching**: Combined pan and long-press handlers

### üìä Performance Metrics

- **Target**: 60 FPS maintained during drag
- **Frame Budget**: < 16ms per frame
- **State Updates**: Throttled to pointer movement events only
- **Memory**: No additional allocations during drag (reuses Offset objects)

## üß™ Testing

- [x] Tap card to make active
- [x] Tap active card to play
- [x] Tap and hold deck card to drag
- [x] Tap and hold active card to re-drag

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### üí° Potential Additions

1. **Throw Detection**: Detect fast downward drag as "throw" gesture
2. **Discard Zone**: Visual target area for discarding cards
3. **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration on grab/release (mobile)
4. **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for interactions
5. **Card Rotation**: Slight tilt during drag for physicality
6. **Multi-touch**: Support for dragging multiple cards (tablet)
7. **Gesture Customization**: User preferences for interaction style

### üî® Code Improvements

1. **Animation Curves**: More polished easing functions
2. **State Machine**: Formalize interaction states (Idle ‚Üí Hover ‚Üí Drag)
3. **Gesture Recognition**: Custom recognizer for more control
4. **Performance Profiling**: Detailed FPS metrics collection
