---

## 🎨 Frontend Architecture: Flutter-First Design

### 🧰 Core Foundation

The I/O FLIP frontend leverages the **Flutter Casual Games Toolkit** as its foundational architecture, providing essential game development capabilities:

- 🔊 **Audio** functionality
- 🔄 **Lifecycle management**
- 🧭 **Navigation** through `go_router` package

This toolkit-based approach accelerates development by providing pre-built components for common game mechanics while maintaining flexibility for custom implementations.

### 📱 Responsive Web-First Design

The application follows a **responsive web-first design philosophy**:

- ✅ **Dynamic resizing** based on screen dimensions
- ✅ **Adaptive input handling** (touch vs. mouse)
- ✅ **Cross-platform** compatibility (web, mobile, desktop)
- ✅ **Unified rendering engine** (no platform-specific code)

### 🏗️ State Management & Component Architecture

#### Feature-First Organization

The game implements a **feature-first architectural pattern** consistent with Very Good Ventures' best practices:

```
features/
├── authentication/
│   ├── presentation/
│   ├── application/
│   └── domain/
├── game/
│   ├── presentation/
│   ├── application/
│   └── domain/
├── cards/
│   ├── presentation/
│   ├── application/
│   └── domain/
└── leaderboard/
    ├── presentation/
    ├── application/
    └── domain/
```

#### BLoC Pattern

State management utilizes **BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern**:

- ✅ Predictable state transitions
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Business logic independent of UI
- ✅ Stream-based state management
- ✅ Excellent testability

### 🎨 Advanced Rendering & Visual Effects

#### Custom Fragment Shaders

One of I/O FLIP's most impressive technical achievements is its implementation of **custom fragment shaders** for creating holographic foil effects on special cards.

**Technology:**
- OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)
- GPU-accelerated rendering
- Per-pixel visual effects

**Shader Parameters:**
| Parameter | Purpose | Range |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Strength** | Foil effect intensity | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| **Saturation** | Color intensity | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| **Lightness** | Brightness level | 0.0 - 1.0 |

#### GameCard Widget

The **GameCard widget** serves as the central UI component:

```
GameCard
├── Name (Text)
├── Description (Text)
├── Image (Asset)
├── Power (Number)
├── Elemental Border (Style)
└── Shader Effects (GLSL)
```

**Benefits:**
- 🔄 **Reusable** across the application
- 🎨 **Consistent** visual presentation
- 🧩 **Composable** from data models

## ⚙️ Backend Architecture: Server-Authoritative Design

### 🦎 Dart Frog: Full-Stack Dart Implementation

The backend architecture centers around **Dart Frog**, a lightweight server framework that enables full-stack Dart development.

#### Why Dart Frog?

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🔤 **Single Language** | Same language for frontend and backend |
| 📦 **Code Sharing** | Share models, logic, and utilities |
| ⚡ **Fast Development** | Familiar tools and patterns |
| 🔒 **Type Safety** | Strong typing across the stack |

### 🛡️ Server-Authoritative Game Model

The server implements a **server-authoritative model** where critical game logic executes on the backend:

```
┌─────────────┐                    ┌─────────────┐
│   Client 1  │                    │   Client 2  │
│  (Flutter)  │                    │  (Flutter)  │
└──────┬──────┘                    └──────┬──────┘
       │                                  │
       │ Play Card                 Play Card │
       │                                  │
       ▼                                  ▼
   ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │          Dart Frog Server              │
   │  ────────────────────────────────────  │
   │  1. Validate move                      │
   │  2. Calculate outcome                  │
   │  3. Determine winner                   │
   │  4. Update game state                  │
   └────────┬──────────────────────┬────────┘
            │                      │
            ▼                      ▼
       ┌──────────┐          ┌──────────┐
       │ Update 1 │          │ Update 2 │
       └──────────┘          └──────────┘
```

   │                       │                       │
   ├──── Connect ─────────>│<────── Connect ──────┤
   │                       │                       │
   ├──── Join Match ──────>│<────── Join Match ───┤
   │                       │                       │
   │                  Match Started                │
   │                       │                       │
   ├──── Play Card ───────>│                       │
   │                       ├──── Update ──────────>│
   │<───── Update ─────────┤                       │
   │                       │<────── Play Card ─────┤
   │<───── Update ─────────┼──── Update ──────────>│
```
