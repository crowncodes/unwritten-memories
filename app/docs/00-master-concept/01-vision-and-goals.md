## 1. Core Vision: A Life Remembered

Unwritten is a life simulation where **every interaction becomes a memory** and **stories are emergent**. Every playthrough generates a unique life story, not by following a branching script, but by simulating the psychological and emotional journey of a character through a sophisticated generative architecture.

### The Central Promise

Our systems are designed to create emotionally authentic narratives that feel **earned, personal, and unforgettable**.

A generic concept like "Social Connection," through repeated use and significant moments, doesn't just "level up"—it evolves into **"Tuesday Afternoons at Café Luna,"** a unique Contextual Instance imbued with the memory of the conversation where you decided to quit your job, forever changing its emotional weight and narrative function.

### The Player Experience Goal

**Players should look back at their collection of evolved instances not as a set of optimized game pieces, but as a photo album of a life they truly lived.**

## 2. The Foundation: The Gameplay DNA Architecture

The core of Unwritten is the **Three-Layer Generative Architecture**:

1. **Gameplay DNA (The Concepts):** The immutable building blocks of the human experience (e.g., Emotion, Interaction, Spatial Function).
2. **Master Templates (The Archetypes):** Specific implementations of the DNA (e.g., Jealousy, Sanctuary, Mentor). This is where the game expands.
3. **Contextual Instances (The Cards/Events):** The unique, personalized content generated during a playthrough.

This architecture is the key to infinite replayability and sustainable content expansion. It ensures that every card a player sees is both **universally relatable** (grounded in DNA) and **personally unique** (instantiated in context).

## 3. Design Pillars

### Emotional Authenticity

- Every system prioritizes **psychological realism** over gamification
- Driven by the Core Simulation Engines (Personality, Capacity, Resources)
- Mechanics must translate abstract emotional experiences into concrete gameplay
- Success feels earned; failure feels meaningful

### Emergent Storytelling

- No predetermined story branches
- Narrative emerges from the interaction of:
  - The Gameplay DNA Architecture (Concepts → Templates → Instances)
  - Core Simulation Engines (Personality, Capacity, Resources, Memory)
  - The Writers Room AI (narrative generation and literary styling)
  - Player choices and their consequences
- **Narrative Priming by Writers Room embeds potential in every moment**
- **Memory Facets capture multiple dimensions of experience**
- **Fusion creates emergent symbolism when concepts converge**

### Memory as Progression

- Traditional "power progression" is replaced by **narrative progression**
- Master Templates evolve through meaningful use, creating unique Contextual Instances
- The Archive (`ENGINE_MEMORY`) is not a trophy case—it's a life journal that powers future narrative generation

## 4. Target Experience Qualities

### Novel-Quality Output

Every completed life should feel like a coherent, literary story with:
- Clear character arc
- Thematic consistency
- Emotional peaks and valleys
- Satisfying narrative resolution

### Infinite Replayability

Achieved through the Gameplay DNA Architecture:
- **7 Strands of Gameplay DNA** covering the human experience
- **300 Master Templates** that instantiate differently based on infinite contexts
- **9 Life Directions** that reshape template probability and evolution paths
- **Procedural character generation** that creates unique starting conditions
- **Emergent relationship dynamics** that are never the same twice

### Psychological Depth

The game simulates:
- **Perception vs. Reality**: How personality shapes what you notice
- **Capacity Limits**: When you're too overwhelmed to help others
- **Earned Growth**: Relationships and skills that require authentic investment, not grinding
- **Circumstance Stacking**: How multiple stressors compound realistically

---

## 5. The Three Pillars of Authenticity

### 1. Emotional Authenticity Engine

**Best-in-class integration of:**
- `emotional_capacity` as a slow-moving resilience resource
- `memory_resonance` connecting current events to past experiences
- Personality modifiers that shape every interaction
- Capacity-gated perception (can't see what you're too stressed to notice)
- **Narrative Priming's role in dynamic storytelling** via context-sensitive outcome probability shifts

### 2. Universal Evolution Principle

**Every card—from mundane to momentous—can evolve:**
- A simple `act_coffee_with_friend` becomes a cherished ritual
- A location like `loc_favorite_cafe` accrues layers of meaning
- Evolution requires both mechanical thresholds AND narrative moments
- No grinding—only authentic growth through lived experience

### 3. Circumstance Stacking

**Multiple simultaneous stressors interact realistically:**
- `evt_health_crisis` + `evt_financial_emergency` = compounded devastation
- System actively tracks and mechanizes how life challenges layer
- Creates the authentic feeling of "when it rains, it pours"

## 6. What Unwritten Is NOT

### Not a Deckbuilder

- You don't optimize a deck for efficiency
- You don't "draft" the best cards
- Card evolution is narrative, not mechanical advantage

### Not a Dating Sim

- Relationships are a core element but not the only story
- You can't "romance route" an NPC through correct dialogue choices
- NPCs have their own lives, limits, and Emotional Capacity

### Not a Hero's Journey

- There is no villain to defeat
- There is no "winning" condition
- Success is about authentic self-discovery and connection

### Not a Power Fantasy

- You will face setbacks you cannot overcome
- You will make choices with no "right" answer
- You will experience loss, regret, and limitation

## 7. Success Metrics

### Player Experience

- **Emotional Investment**: Players should feel genuine emotion about their character's story
- **Memory Creation**: Players should remember specific moments, not just outcomes
- **Replayability**: Each new life should feel fundamentally different
- **Narrative Coherence**: Every life should feel like a complete story

### Technical Performance

- **60 FPS** gameplay (game engine smooth)
- **< 15ms** AI inference (no noticeable lag)
- **< 10%** battery drain per 30min session
- **< 200MB** memory usage
- **< 50MB** app size (without assets)

### Narrative Quality

- Every life generates **novel-quality prose**
- Stories exhibit clear **3-act structure** within seasons
- Character decisions show **psychological consistency**
- Outcomes feel **earned and authentic**

## 8. The Competitive Differentiation

### What Makes Unwritten Unique

**No other life sim combines:**

1. **On-device AI inference** for real-time narrative generation
2. **Psychological simulation** as the core progression system
3. **Memory-based evolution** where every card becomes personal
4. **The Writers Room AI** that creates literary-quality emergent stories
5. **True replayability** through procedural template instantiation

### Vs. Traditional Life Sims

- **The Sims**: Sandbox freedom but no narrative depth
- **Bitlife**: Text-based choices but no emotional simulation
- **Stardew Valley**: Routine-based but predetermined content

**Unwritten**: Combines narrative depth, psychological authenticity, and infinite replayability through emergent AI-driven storytelling.

## 9. Long-Term Vision

### Base Game (61 Cards → 300 Templates)

- Complete coverage of **young adult life** (ages 20-35)
- All 9 Life Directions fully supported
- Robust relationship and career systems
- Foundation for all future content

### Expansion Strategy: Exponential Value

**Depth over breadth:**

The Gameplay DNA Architecture enables sustainable expansion. New Master Templates don't just add content—they create **exponential narrative expansion**.

**300 base templates + 50 expansion templates ≠ 350 total stories.**

It equals **exponential growth** because new templates:
- Introduce new fusion opportunities with existing templates
- Add evolution branches to current instances
- Create new narrative threads that interact with the entire ecosystem
- Multiply replayability through combinatorial complexity

**Planned Expansions:**

- **"Unwritten: Parenthood"** - 50 templates for the complete parenting arc
- **"Unwritten: The Crossroads"** - 50 templates for mid-life transformation
- **"Unwritten: Digital Self"** - 40 templates for modern online life
- **"Unwritten: The Long Struggle"** - 40 templates for chronic illness and systemic challenges

Each expansion provides massive narrative potential by leveraging the existing DNA foundation.

## 10. The Promise to Players

**"Every life tells a story worth remembering."**

When a player completes a life in Unwritten, they should:

1. **Feel something real** about what happened
2. **Remember specific moments** that mattered
3. **Want to share their story** with others
4. **Know it could never happen the same way twice**

This is not a game about winning. It's a game about **living, remembering, and understanding what it means to be human**.
